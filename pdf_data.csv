Questions of justice have been raised in recent years when contending with the social
costs of urban sprawl. But this field of inquiry suffers from the difficulty of translating
the abstract notion of justice into measurable spatial indices. The aim of this paper is to
empirically measure the liberal notion of justice in the metropolitan region of Tel Aviv
by adopting Pierre Bourdieu ’s theory of three forms of capital. Under this theory, the
formation of economic, cultural, and social capital in the individual ’s living environ-
ment determines the person ’s exposure to different sets of life-chances (i.e., capabil-
ities), thus influencing equality of opportunity (i.e., social justice) in space. The
analysis reveals that suburban inhabitants benefit from a larger accumulation of the
three forms of capital than do urban inhabitants. Accumulation of these capitals has a
positive effect on exposure to life-chances, thus enhancing spatial segregation between
cities and suburbs.
Keywords: social justice; capital accumulation; capabilities; city versus suburbs
Introduction
Justice has always fed fundamental societal deliberations. The very meaning of the term,
justice, has been deliberated vigorously in the course of human history (Sandel, 2009 ).
However, the question of how to translate this concept into measurable indices reflecting
the complexities of inequality among social classes remains unresolved. In the spatial
sciences, the discourse on justice has appeared occasionally, notably from the mid-
twentieth century with respect to the social consequences of suburbanization trends
(e.g., Marsh, Parnell, & Joyner, 2010 ; Williamson, 2010 ). In spite of the developing
discourse, research in this field is somewhat lacking. The literature has focused on
measuring economic and environmental costs but has neglected social aspects in the
wake of unrestricted suburbanization processes. Therefore, aspects of life-chances, of
equal opportunities, and of social reproduction have been ignored in most of this body
of literature.
This paper aims at helping to fill these theoretical and empirical lacunae by suggesting
a new epistemological framework in which the liberal, abstract notion of justice can be
spatially tested and measured. The study employs the class structure of modern capitalist
societies as conceptualized by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu ( 1986b ). His
concept is based on the production, accumulation, and transmission of three forms of
capital: economic, cultural, and social. These three forms enable both individuals and

capabilities (or opportunities and life-chances) benefiting the social subject.
Although Bourdieu did not directly refer to spatial assessments, a growing body of
literature in recent years has related to social –spatial phenomena through Bourdieu ’s
theoretical conception (see, e.g., Açikalin, 2011 ; Painter, 2000 ). These studies show that
his theorization is relevant to spatial disciplines, since it may reveal different life circum-
stances that might hamper or alleviate a person ’s exposure to life-chances.
The social stratification analysis proposed by Bourdieu serves in the current paper as a
means of depicting class structure. The spatio-political arrangements affected by this
stratification formulate and shape life-chances and, thus, equality of opportunity (i.e.,
social justice). Moreover, social processes within built environments influence the patterns
in which social goods are distributed (Hillier, 2008 ). It is assumed that impairing the
capability to produce and accumulate Bourdieu capital forms, as the process of suburba-
nization is suspected of doing, by deepening social segregation constitutes an explicit sign
of social injustice in space.
This paper places the social discussion on capital forms and the way to measure their
distribution in space in the context of Amartya Sen ’s theory of justice. As most social
phenomena are complex and linked to multiple bodies of knowledge, this paper focuses
on a multidisciplinary approach whose aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding
of the relationship between (in)justice and spatiality. The study offers a new perspective to
the reciprocal interactions between central cities and suburbs. An empirical examination
of these interactions took place in the main metropolitan region of Israel.
Theoretical background
Suburbanization, urban sprawl, and social justice
Questions of justice and social well-being have for many centuries posed a major topic of
deliberation in political philosophy. Recently, these issues have been raised within the
spatial discourse, with an attempt to understand, measure, and manage the outcomes of
suburbanization and urban sprawl on the life-chances of individuals and social groups. In
particular, the issue has become central because of the growing need to achieve sustain-
able and fair urban development (Roberts, 2003 ).
The discussions of justice in the past referred to different sets of objects and principles
of allocation (Rawls, 1971 ; Sandel, 2009 ). John Rawls ’(1971 ) liberal theory of justice
gave the philosophical discourse on the subject its most significant encouragement.
According to his theory, “primary goods ”should be distributed among the society ’s
members ( 2001 , pp. 58 –61). However, Rawls ’s approach for measuring justice is not
sufficiently complex and flexible for the purpose of empirical research (Young, 2006 ). It
was the Bengali economist Amartya Sen ( 1992 ) who defined life-chances as a major
metric of justice. According to his approach, life-chances (or “capabilities ”) will be equal
only when all individuals have the same opportunity to function well in different social
fields. This opportunity stems from the ability to convert services and goods (i.e.,
education, money, health, and social relations) into real functioning (Nussbaum, 2006 ;
Sen, 1992 ). The two terms, capabilities and functionings, might help in the attempt to
measure justice. They signify the opportunities (or life-chances) that enable people to
choose the kind of lifestyle they wish to pursue and to function effectively in fields of life
that they value (Robeyns & Brighouse, 2010 ). Justice, according to Sen ’s theory, is not
only the achieving of functionings, but also being able to achieve them in accordance withUrban Geography 579one’s consciousness of the value of one ’s own capabilities (Fainstein, 2010 ; Robeyns &
Brighouse, 2010 ).
Capabilities and functionings are highly affected by the background conditions against
which any action takes place. A person ’s capabilities pack is a joint product of personal
characteristics and the social and physical environments.1The social dimension refers to
institutions, social norms, traditions, and the behavior of others in society: stereotyping,
prejudiced behavior, racism, and homophobic behavior. Physical environment refers to the
physical attributes of the place or district where a person lives, but it is also influenced by
internal and external personal endowments, such as one ’s mental and physical attributes
(Robeyns, 2005 ).
In the context of justice, suburbanization and urban sprawl have been accused of
imposing a significant cost on spatial equity (Jargowsky, 2001 ; Ledwith & Clark, 2007 ;
Marsh et al., 2010 ; Rusk, 1998 ). The main social argument is that the migration of
affluent populations from the core city to the suburban fringes resulted in extreme
distributive inequality, manifested in social segregation, squandering of public resources,
and urban decline (Brinegar & Leonard, 2008 ; Freilich & Peshoff, 1997 ; Galster &
Cutsinger, 2007 ; Jargowsky, 2001 ). In Sen ’s terminology, this migration implies that the
deep social cleavage between cities and suburbs might have been concealing deep
inequality in human capabilities to flourish and prosper.
However, the individual ’s freedom to choose the ideal community in which to live
may negatively affect the liberty of other individuals who are not part of this community,
thereby casting doubt on its morality (Williamson, 2010 ). In that context, sprawl and the
social deprivation it allegedly causes negatively affect the ability of large sectors in a
given metropolitan region to materialize their positive liberties. These are the capabilities
as Sen defines the term (Sen, 1987 ,p .3 6 )2—the ability to be free to realize legitimate
aspirations and, therefore, to benefit from this spatial process.
Nevertheless, the relationship between sprawl and diminishing personal liberties is not
surprising, as it laid the ground for discouraging trust and social interaction between
different communities within metropolitan areas (Freeman, 2001 ; Leyden, 2003 ; Rahn,
Yoon, Garet, Lipson, & Loflin, 2009 ). It is speculated that big and ethnically diverse cities
reduce social solidarity and, therefore, social capital (Putnam, 2007 ). In contrast, the
creation of elite and distinctive entities at the metropolitan fringes seems to produce the
opposite effect: enhancement of social interaction within suburban communities and
strengthening of their inner trust relationships (Brueckner & Largey, 2008 ). Recently,
these elite entities were associated with civic disengagement, avoidance of political
conflicts, and constant withdrawal of suburbanites to personal spheres of life
(Baumgartner, 1988 ; Putnam, 2000 ). The undermining of such practices of citizenship
is assumed to affect the health and vibrancy of any democratic polity (Putnam, 2000 ).
Williamson ’s(2010 ) findings support this allegation, as he found that suburban commu-
nities tended to foster political conservatism, reflecting homophobic and xenophobic
attitudes toward many typical urban communities. In such a political climate, it seems
that the implementation of principles of fairness and equality is an almost unattainable
goal, as social solidarity diminishes and the political willingness to support such actions
becomes unpopular.
Thus, the study of suburbanization and urban decline seems to have created a large
body of literature focusing on the measurement of the costs and benefits of these
phenomena. However, most of these studies have not contributed to the normative
discourse of social justice. Across the geography discipline and beyond, many have
engaged with “justice ”in different ways, raising debates about what is just and what is580 E. Israel and A. Frenkelunjust (Davis, 2011 ). Although the current paper engages with a generally liberal
approach to justice, liberal thinkers such as Sen and Rawls did not refer to space directly.
This is mostly true also of other philosophical streams of thought that reflect on justice,
thus posing a serious impediment to potential attempts to translate justice into an
empirical measurement (Campbell & Marshall, 2006 ; Young, 1990 ).
Over the years, some basic principles were set in order to define spatial –social justice
(Hay, 1995 ; Smith, 1994 ). David Harvey ( 1973 ), for example, in defining the notion of
“territorial social justice ”emphasizes issues of production as a structural dynamic that
characterizes capitalist societies and leads to an unjust distribution of resources in space.
Leaving production to the workings of the free market (as Rawls did in his theory)
eventually results in uneven geographical development —an intrinsic feature of the capi-
talist mode of production and, in consequence, indifferent forms of oppression.
Oppression and discrimination in this regard manifest eminent expressions of injustice
(Harvey, 1996 ,1992 ).
Harvey ’s Marxian stance was further developed by critical geographers, who empha-
sized the issue of injustice in the contemporary capitalist urban world (Dikec, 2001 ;
Mitchell, 2003 ). The notion of spatial justice as discussed recently by Ed Soja ( 2010a )
offers a noticeable example of this approach. Soja critically explores systematic articula-
tions of human suffering, defined in terms of modes of subordination, exploitation, and
segregation among individuals and groups, and generally manifesting the asymmetry of
power relations along lines of cultural, gender, race, and class cleavages (Lefebvre, 1991 ;
Soja, 2010a ).3
Moreover, under the paradigm of spatial justice, the very process of creating space that
exhibits unfortunate outcomes of human suffering is itself a subject of critical inquiry
(Marcuse, 2010 ; Soja, 2010b ). Focusing on processes and outcomes, spatial justice
attempts to diverge from just discerning whether a particular event is just or unjust.
Rather, it aims to explore “. . . dynamic processes of social, spatial, economic, and
political formations in order to see if they operate in such a way to produce and reproduce
dominant and oppressive permanences which would be considered as being unjust ”
(Dikec, 2001 , p. 1793). This normative, epistemological stance, however, might be highly
problematic in gaining an understanding of justice and its potential metrics.
To start with, take the question of the unjust that is raised by Dikec, Soja, and others.
What should we look for in trying to define the term? Asymmetry in power relations? If
so, how should power be defined in relation to justice and processes of creating space?
How do we know that a person or a group of people are dominated by power spatial
relationships? What is the meaning of domination or exploitation here, and how can one
assess it without raising a normative doubt that is rooted in biased judgments?
We do not really know how to answer such questions if we take literally the
theoretical issues posed by critical geographers. Within this context, spatial justice
theorization does not lead to an effective mode of translating the normative notion of
justice as analyzed in political philosophy into a potentially measurable metric. In the field
of Critical Geography, justice is usually referred to merely as a buzzword. Critical spatial
writings seem to start their analyses from widely shared intuitions of injustice, thus
overlooking and missing strong conceptions that define justice (Barnett, 2011 ; Olson &
Sayer, 2009 ). Critical analyses of space, such as Soja ’s or even Harvey ’s(1973 ) Marxist
variant of urban social justice, approached the concept of justice as a vehicle to set
research agendas. These critiques seem to be directed at catalyzing “more participatory
forms of social activism and a spatially attuned democratic politics ”(Soja, 2010a ,p .1 ) .Urban Geography 581Furthermore, utopian approaches to urban planning, represented by such theorists as
Peter Marcuse ( 2009 ) and Susan Fainstein ( 2010 ), reflect additional attempts to under-
stand justice in its urban meaning. However, the call for what they perceive as the “Just
City, ”did not define a metric in which justice could be measured within diverse spatial
contexts. Fainstein, for example, suggested three indicators by which a Just City could be
identified: democracy, equity, and diversity. But as Fainstein herself admits, integrating
these three concepts might constitute a complex task to preserve, since they could
contradict one another. This would be the case, for example, with the concept of diversity,
an important measure of quality of life that usually favors the city (Jacobs, 1961 ;
Sandercock, 2003 ). Making cities more diverse might contradict the concept of equity
(Florida, 2002 ). It might also come up against the concept of democracy by pushing social
diversity so that the result is to encourage communal exclusionary tendencies while
reducing social solidarity (Harvey, 1997 ; Putnam, 2007 ). Beyond its conceptual –moral
intricacy, Fainstein ’s theory is like the other critical theories mentioned in the sense that
they do not totally clarify the meaning of their concepts for an individual ’s actual life-
chances.
Moreover, since most of the authors who discussed the spatial meaning of justice
favored qualitative methods —as did Fainstein, Harvey, and Soja —it was especially
difficult to generalize their empirical results. Under a critical-utopian perspective, it
apparently becomes more complicated to set a metric of justice in space that can easily
be measured and analyzed at the individual level. Is an individual confined insofar as
possibilities, life-chances, mental feelings, happiness, or self-confidence? The answer
emanating from socio-spatial theories of justice would probably be intuitively positive.
But intuition might not be enough, as other normative outlooks may argue. For example,
what might constitute an unjust exploitation for one person could be conceived as proper
arrangement by another person if it falls within the category of liberties guaranteed in
democratic societies (as echoed in Robert Nozick ’s(1974 ) entitlement theory or in
neoliberal economic theories).
The search for a measurable term of justice, as was done recently by the philosophers
Brighouse and Robeyns ( 2010 ), is neglected by urban utopian and critical geographers.
This is not surprising, since the social sciences differ fundamentally from the normative
argument of inequality that philosophers of justice contemplate. It certainly differs from
political –academic exertions that are targeted to promote social –political agendas and
challenge social injustices (Sayer, 2011 ). Eventually, the difficulty in translating the
meaning of justice into spatial measurement led many scholars to use economic indices
in their measurement of spatial –social gaps and costs (e.g., Foster-Bey et al., 2002 ;
Jargowsky, 2001 ; Persky & Wiewel, 2000 ).
Notion of capital resources and their spatial meaning
The present study uses principles of justice based on equality of liberties (i.e., capabilities
or life-chances) to measure justice in space.4In order to determine a comprehensive
framework of understanding one ’s set of capabilities, it is necessary to explore personal,
social, and environmental background conditions that influence their creation (Robeyns,
2005 ). Using Bourdieu ’s capital forms theory might be beneficial in this context. The
integration of the two theoretical concepts (i.e., Sen ’s and Bourdieu ’s) enlarges the
traditional economic-monolithic indices or variables used in most of the studies that
explored the social costs of urban sprawl.582 E. Israel and A. FrenkelBourdieu ’s epistemological idea depicts the class structure of modern capitalist socie-
ties in accordance with the production, accumulation, and transmission of three forms of
capital: Economic capital comprises wages and other forms of monetary assets, such as
stocks or property (Becker & Woessmann, 2009 ).Cultural capital comprises not only
educational qualifications and achievements, but also tastes, preferences, and general
“know-how ”and knowledge; it affects cognitive skills and the knowledge of normative
codes through socialization processes (Bourdieu, 1986b , pp. 243 –248). In this context,
social capital is defined as the total extent and quality of social networks and connections
that one uses to promote personal interests (Bourdieu, 1986b ). Bourdieu suggests that the
accumulation of the three forms of capital determines a social space that defines class-
related inequalities in a variety of spheres of life (Bourdieu, 1989 ,1985 ). In this social
space, the different forms of capital enable an individual and his/her respective social peer
groups to achieve a variety of social goods in diverse fields of life (Bourdieu & Wacquant,
1992 ). These social goods might later be translated into capabilities or life-chances for the
social subject (Bowman, 2010 ). Thus, the social stratification analysis that Bourdieu
proposed defines distributional patterns that might erode social justice and, therefore,
gnaw away at equal opportunities.
Within their dependency and reciprocal substitution, the three forms of capital show
multidimensional functions, in which each can serve as an input for the creation of
another form or as an output obtained from it. Their function (as input or output) differs
in different persons. For example, economic capital for an adult person could be used as
an input for creating cultural capital for his/her children. Nonetheless, each of the different
capital resources is distinct in terms of diffuseness and reciprocal conversion (Savage,
Warde, & Devine, 2005 ). The multidimensional relationships of these forms of capital
provide an explanation for the complexity of social stratification in Western capitalist
societies. The ability to operationalize the three forms in different social fields determines
the class structure of those societies. Concomitantly, reflecting a complex social topogra-
phy can be connected to different living environments, in which income levels and other
indicators of material and cultural characteristics vary according to geographical setting
(Buzzelli, 2007 ). Recent years have revealed a growing geographical interest in
Bourdieu ’s sociological theory, relating to spatial process and practices of distinction
and segregation, especially in relation to housing and education on the urban scale
(Bridge, 2001 ,2006 ; Butler & Robson, 2001 ), as well as on the metropolitan scale
(Butler & Robson, 2003 ; Webber, 2007 ). The formation of capital forms is perceived to
be dependent on high-standard amenities and creative social –cultural environments
(Carpiano, 2006 ; Podmore, 1998 ; Wynne & O ’Connor, 1998 ). Therefore, capital forms
and their mutual conversions into power relationships design spatial political arrange-
ments that reflect ideological differences, stigmas, segregation, and other forces that shape
people ’s lives (Carpiano, 2006 ; Marom, 2014 ; Painter, 2000 ).
Not surprisingly, Bourdieu ’s theory was utilized to express moral criticism in reference
to exploitation and the denial of an adequate material standard of living to many margin-
alized groups (Fraser, 1997 ). It seems, then, that this theory has the potential to provide
satisfactory, critical, and yet empirical insights into the ways in which social groups
mobilize power and increase their exposure to life-chances (capabilities, in Sen ’s termi-
nology) as the philosophy of justice implies (e.g., Barry, 2006 ).5Bonding sociology to the
normative discussion of justice in relation to the spatial phenomenon of sprawl could
illuminate the social mechanisms that produce it and, in particular, the symbolic meanings
attached to the human practices involved in the creation of distinct suburbs.Urban Geography 583Study framework
Research goals and hypotheses
In order to deal with the complex issues discussed in the previous sections, two basic
questions must be asked: Under the liberal theory of justice, can the phenomenon of
suburbanization be seen as a fair process? And are democratic and liberal societies able to
determine that suburbanization does not cause avoidable suffering to various social
groups, even though this process stands as a cornerstone of liberal, laissez-faire
approaches that honor individualism and the maximization of private utility?
Accordingly, the aim of the current paper is to add a spatial dimension to the analytical
inquiry into social justice. More specifically, we will refer to liberties or opportunities in
order to conduct a measurable examination of what can be seen as spatial justice. To do
so, the current study translates Bourdieu ’s and Sen ’s theories into measurable indices that
can be used to estimate the spatial differences between cities and suburbs. We speculated
that by identifying spatial gaps in capital accumulation between these two entities, we
would be able to understand different accesses to life-chances (i.e., capabilities) and,
hence, manifestations of spatial –social injustice.
The main hypothesis of the present work is that a positive linkage exists between the
accumulation of capital (economic, social, and cultural) at the individual level and one ’s
living environment, on the one hand, and the individual ’s exposure to life-chances, on the
other. Suburbanization processes, under this hypothesis, act as an accelerator of social
segregation, reinforcing capital gaps and inequality in a region. In consequence, capital
accumulation and the exposure to life-chances are influenced by the spatial organization
of settlements (cities vs. suburbs). The extent to which a social subject is exposed to life-
chances affects equal opportunities and, therefore, social justice in space.
Capital resources are constituted at two distinct levels, influencing at each an indivi-
dual’s own wealth in a variety of fields of life. First, there is the personal level, generated
mainly by the individual ’s family and close social circle, which acts to foster and nourish
capital generation. Second, there is the local-municipal level, which is manifested in the
municipality ’s investment policy toward local services and directed at cultural and social
augmentation. Without being equipped with sufficient accumulation of capital resources,
individuals will find it difficult to realize what can be seen as a positive liberty or what
Bourdieu ( 1986b ) perceived as the ability to attain respected positions on the social ladder.
Capital accumulation influences personal life-chances and, thus, one ’s personal capabil-
ities, the aim of which is to improve desirable functioning that will lead to achievements
facilitating the obtaining of social positions.
The suggested theoretical scrutiny facilitates concretization of a potential metric of
human well-being that in addition expresses the social and spatial mechanisms that
determine what could be conceived as justice in space. Understanding human capabilities
through its observation under a spatial lens promotes our comprehension of a person ’s
mental feelings, such as happiness or self-confidence, in regard to what he or she could be
or do. This understanding definitely goes beyond regular intuition of injustice, as it
depicts the spatiality of justice or injustice in a concrete and normative manner.
Specifically, the effect of suburbanization processes on the ability of suburbanites to
accumulate capital derives from the creation of distinct affluent communities. These social
groups negatively affect the capabilities of those who are left behind (Jargowsky, 2001 ),
therefore impairing the remaining social groups ’freedom to function in different social
fields and to live the kind of life they value. Accordingly, the hypothesis is that sub-
urbanites are the beneficiaries of more ample and diverse capital resources than many of584 E. Israel and A. Frenkeltheir urban counterparts enjoy. What makes the spatial layout of a settlement unjust or
just, according to this hypothesis, is not its formation per se, but the way the forms of
capital are distributed among the different types of settlements in the region. It is assumed
that suburban social homogeneity facilitates the creation, accumulation, and the transfer of
capital forms, whereas urban heterogeneity hampers them.
The three forms of capital enable individuals to achieve a variety of social goods in
diverse fields of life as Bourdieu and Wacquant ( 1992 ) claim. Under these circumstances,
we expect that suburbanites would be exposed to more life-chances and would raise their
position in the social hierarchy. As a consequence, and according to Sen ’s theory of
capabilities, this situation may well lead to regional inequality and social injustice in
space.
Data sources
The study ’s empirical analysis focused on the central region of Israel, specifically the area
that is included within the boundaries of the Tel Aviv metropolis. It is a large area
covering 1,518 km2comprising 7% of the territory of Israel. A total of 3.2 million people,
constituting 43.5% of the total Israeli population, resided in the region in 2008, in 59
municipalities (including cities, local councils, and regional councils6). The Tel Aviv
metropolis is characterized by a high level of specialization in finance and business
activities (more than double the national average rate). It serves as the financial and
administrative center at the national level. The region ’s economy has exhibited accelerated
growth, especially in the first half of the 1990s, which was expressed by increases in
labor, in the rate of employment, and in gross domestic product. As a result, this
metropolitan region experienced intense suburbanization trends, the costs of which for
the metropolitan society are under polemic debate (Razin & Shachar, 2007 ). Many small
towns and rural communities within regional councils grew in population to become
classic residential suburbs surrounding major cities in the region (see Figure 1 ). This rapid
population growth characterized the metropolitan region ’s outer rings, as well. The trend
reflected the emigration of large portions of affluent social groups from the core to the
fringes of the metropolitan region. The alleged result was the creation of spatial segrega-
tion between cities and suburbs (Gonen, 1995 ; Marom, 2014 ). In this respect, the
suburbanization trends that characterized the Tel Aviv metropolitan region followed the
same path of urban sprawl detected in other parts of the developed world (Razin, Dijst, &
Vazques, 2007 ).7
The 59 independent municipalities composing the Tel Aviv metropolitan region served
as the research unit for the empirical examination.8Data were collected from available
institutional data sets, including local authorities ’data sets, the Social Survey and Labor
Force Survey of the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, and reports of the Israeli Ministry
of the Interior. Using this variety of sources to probe the research questions obviated the
use of the preferable census-tract data to detect fine-grained observations in each munici-
pality. Rather, it enabled dividing the 59 municipalities into two groups of urban forms:
cities and suburbs.9Owing to the absence of a formal distinction between these two
spatial entities, the present study employed several criteria taken from the literature to
distinguish between cities and their suburbs. These indicators included population growth
rate, immigration balance, population density, proportion of the residential area of the total
built-up area, commuting rate, and transit mode to work (Warner & Hefetz, 2003 ,p .5 ;
Williamson, 2010 , pp. 57 –84). The typology obtained presented 25 cities and 34 suburbs,
as well as a distinction between typical agrarian regional councils and regional councilsUrban Geography 585that experienced significant suburbanization trends over the past few decades; the latter
were converted into semi-urban entities (Sofer & Applebaum, 2006 ).
Methodology
A multivariable database representing personal capabilities and the three Bourdieuian
capital forms was created from the official governmental data sets. The variables, which
were defined in accordance with the data collected, represent individual or overall local
(i.e., municipal) capital wealth and life-chances. The list of variables, their expected
impact on capital accumulation, and general data are given in Appendix 1. In that table,
variables 1 –12 present economic capital, variables 13 –24 cultural capital, variables 25 –33

In order to measure the gap between cities and suburbs in inhabitants ’capital
accumulation and life-chances, three types of statistical models were used in the analysis:
factor analysis, difference-of-means t-test, and multiple regression models.
Factor analysis was employed as a data-reduction procedure on the sets of variables in
order to test the theoretical definitions presented in the literature. This method enabled a
grouping of the variables in each capital form and in selected life-chances into major
factors10(see Galster et al., 2001 ). Each factor comprises a linear combination of all
measures in each relevant field of knowledge and contributes to the total explanation of
the variance (Kim & Mueller, 1978 ). The dominant variables in each factor enabled a
categorization and labeling of the unique “identity ”of the factor.11Labeling is an
important step, since it allows a common terminology when examining the consistency
of the outcome by means of the theoretical definitions of the three Bourdieuian capital
forms and life-chances discussed earlier. These major factors actually manifest the ability
to measure life-chances and capital accumulation empirically, thus justifying their use in
estimating distributive inequality in space.
The next step involved building of local capital profiles, using the component scores
obtained by the factor analysis for each factor. The scores were used to calculate a
weighted index according to the percentage of the variance explained by each of the
factors obtained in each relevant field. The weighted indices represent the total level of
local capital presented by each of the three capital assets and life-chances. t-tests were
applied to find the difference in weighted indices between urban and suburban entities.
Finally, multiple linear regression models were employed in order to examine the
spatial impact of different capital resources on local life-chances. The major factors
produced from the component scores of each form of capital served as explanatory
variables, thereby representing their contribution to the weighted index of the local life-
chances (the dependent variable). In the regression models, different combinations of
factors belonging to the three forms of capital were used to avoid multicollinearity.

Measuring capital forms and life-chances
The factor loadings derived from the principal component analysis procedures employed
on the list of variables in each of the three capital forms and life-chances are presented in
Tables 1 –4. The analysis produced 3 –4 main factors in each form of capital and in its
related life-chances, with a total explained variance of more than 60%. At the overall
level, the data set shows good sampling adequacy (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure:
0.623 –0.712). The results also match the previously defined continuums presented in
Appendix 1.
Economic capital
The first factor, “Material Inputs —Potential and Allocation, ”explained 24% of the total
variance; this factor represents the investment (potential and actual) in acquiring and
elaborating all sorts of capital goods ( Table 1 ). It comprises, for example, variables that
represent private motorization rates and local authorities ’income. In many developed
countries, the latter express a municipality ’s potential to invest economic inputs, which
might assist in enhancing its inhabitants ’welfare and living amenities (Fennell, 2001 ).
The present study pointed to the rate of BA students studying in private academic colleges
with high tuition as an indicator of economic capital, since for the most part only
economically well-established families can afford such institutions. The second economic
capital factor, “Human Capital, ”explained 18.3% of the total variance. The main con-
tributor to this factor is the percentage of upper white-collar professions ( Table 1 );

important, since the average income of women in Israel (as in many other countries) is
generally lower than men ’s income. Human capital, therefore, is considered an essential
factor in contributing to economic growth (Becker & Woessmann, 2009 ).12
The third factor, “Inter-Generational Stability and Economic Support, ”explained
17.3% of the total variance; it comprises variables that manifest intergenerational stability,
such as owning an additional house or the rate of inhabitants entitled to income support
from the state. The factor allows detecting local authorities that have attracted social
groups with the ability to preserve and enhance all sorts of capital forms in order to better
execute functionings in a variety of fields of life. The last factor, “Welfare Standards, ”
articulates an index of perceived economic welfare; although it contributes the lowest
share of the explained variance (13.3%), this factor indicates the level of economic
welfare characterizing local inhabitants.
Cultural capital
The first factor, explaining 24% of the variance, represents “Institutionalized Cultural
Capital ”(Table 2 ). It is composed of university degrees, matriculation attainments, and
dropout rates, which act as antecedent roots in explaining institutionalized credentials
(both academic and nonacademic). For example, dropout rates are negatively related to

the detection of municipalities where local inhabitants might benefit from the ability to
convert cultural capital into economic dividends and from the intergenerational cultivation
of cultural capital inputs that preserve cultural-economic patterns of distinction in space
(De Graaf, De Graaf, & Kraaykamp, 2000 ; Roscigno, Tomaskovic-Devey, & Martha,
2006 ). Indeed, the second factor, “Fostering Inputs, ”which explained 18.3% of the total
variance, represents the relationship between the individual and one ’s family, on the one
hand, and the local authority, on the other hand, in their respective abilities to invest all
sorts of fostering inputs. These inputs are aimed at nurturing and enhancing elements of
cultural assets. For example, the cultural factor is related to professional and academic
credentials and to occupations perceived to have ample cultural capital, such as education,
arts, the humanities, and administration (Bourdieu, 1977 ; De Graaf & Kalmijn, 2001 ).
The third factor, which explained 16.6% of the total variance, represents “Embodied
Cultural Capital, ”which relates to both consciously acquired and passively inherited
properties of one ’s self through socialization processes over time (Bourdieu, 1986b ).
This sort of capital might be embedded in social groups, which convert accumulated
cultural capital into other forms of capital. In this way, they benefit from material
dividends in the market, while enhancing their opportunities in it through, for example,
participating in enrichment classes and knowing foreign languages (Bourdieu & Passeron,
1990 , p. 114). Lingual wealth reduces negative images related to social class or ethnic
origins (De Graaf et al., 2000 ). The last factor, associated with “Symbolic-Objectified
Capital ”at both the personal and the local level, explained 13.3% of the total variance.
This factor relates, for example, to the ability to be accepted by prestigious universities
and to the local authority ’s allocation of land dedicated to cultural and recreational
facilities, symbolic values that might enhance individual dividends in a variety of fields
of life.
Social capital
The first factor manifests local “Individual Social Bonding, ”indicating the level at which
social cohesion exists in the municipality (Carpiano, 2006 ; Putnam, 2000 )(Table 3 ). This
factor, which explained 29.2% of the variance, marks the existence of highly developed
social networks, manifested in the perceived sense of security among community mem-
bers. This factor includes variables representing the locality ’s common moral identity,
which might enhance social networking, a factor that in itself could pay high economic
and cultural dividends in the future (e.g., military service in the Israeli army). In addition,
the factor includes variables of satisfaction in regard to social relationships in the locus.
High rates of trust and moral similarity are considered important features that might lead
to the successful management of local resources and a reduction in the high costs of
supervision and policing (Ostrom, 1990 ).
And indeed, the second social factor, which contributes 21.9% of the variance, is
composed of items that describe local “Social Control and Support Networking ”
(Carpiano, 2006 ). This factor combines variables that indicate volunteering characteristics
in the community (Dipasquale & Glaeser, 1999 ), in contrast to juvenile delinquency levels
and the rate of single-parent households in the locality. The negative sign borne by the
component scores of the last two variables reveals their negative role in producing and
accumulating social capital. For example, single-parent households tend to manifest less
stable lifestyles, greater social distortion, and reduced school achievements (Demo &
Cox, 2000 ).590 E. Israel and A. FrenkelThe last factor, “Municipal Input of Social Bonding, ”combining two budgetary
expenses of the local authority in regard to social bonding, immigration absorption and
security transactions, contributed 13.1% of the variance. The ethnic composition of the
locality represents communal sentiments and social bridging ligatures (Forrest & Kearns,
2001 , p. 2131). The analysis implies that municipalities characterized by high rates of
immigration suffer from reduced social cohesion, a characteristic that might signify social
turmoil, or be a predictor of it (Putnam, 2007 ). Therefore, municipal investment in
immigration absorption reflects efforts to reduce social instability and to strengthen social
capital bridging among the municipality ’s inhabitants. This kind of social capital facil-
itates the building of connections among heterogeneous groups, thus fostering social
inclusion (Schuller, Baron, & Field, 2000 ). The opposite outcome is reflected in a
municipality ’s investments in social control and security measures. The factor indicates
that the weaker the social bonding in a locality, the larger the investment that is needed to
prevent crime and delinquency. Phrased in other terms, the higher the social capital, the
lower is the need to enforce law and order by means of the police and other security
measures (Sampson, 2001 ).
Local “Life-Chances and Personal Capabilities ”were represented by nine variables
listed in Table 4 .
The first factor, manifesting “‘Social-Economic Stability, ”explains 24.8% of the
variance. It consists of commuting, home ownership,13and number of available cars.
Households with 3 –4 children reflect relatively stable and protective nuclear families,
which enable children and young people to develop a healthy lifestyle (Demo & Cox,
2000 ; Peres & Kats, 1981 ). Commuting and the availability of cars represent the cap-
ability to be mobile, accessible, and affiliated to preferred job opportunities in space, thus
securing economic stability and a platform from which to realize personal aspirations. The
factor signifies, among others, a stable and caring family, as well as a capability to be
affiliated with various social organizations and institutions (as their workplace throughTable 3. Factor analysis of social capital: major factorsaand factor loading (KMO = 0.623).

taking part in various social interactions constitutes the social conditions that advance self-
dignity (Nussbaum, 2006 , p.76).
The second factor, “The Ability to Feel Control over the Individual ’s Own Life, ”
explains about 24.5% of the variance. This capability is manifested in individuals ’stated
beliefs regarding perceived satisfaction with their current status in different fields of life.
The optimism or pessimism that emanates from this belief reflects the individual ’s
competence in converting decisions about his/her life into economic-social utilities.14In
that sense, it is consistent with Nussbaum ’s(2006 , p. 77) argument regarding the ability to
participate effectively in political choices that govern one ’s life, to possess property, and
to benefit from the freedom of unwarranted search and seizure of preferred positions in the
labor market.
Finally, the third factor represents an index of “Equal Access ”to preferred work
opportunities (e.g., employment in a field that one studied) and other amenities (e.g., open
spaces), thus determining the personal set of opportunities in space. This last life-chance
factor, which accounts for about 22% of the 72% of the total explained variance, shows
that educated people employed in their field of study tend to enjoy a better environmental
quality of life.
The low level of correlation coefficients ( r< 0.5) obtained in the study among most of
the different factors composing the three forms of capital indicates that these variables are
complementary and do not substitute for one another. Table 5 presents the results of the
statistical analysis ( t-test) conducted to compare cities and suburbs located in the Tel Aviv
metropolitan region. These results show significant differences in integrated indices of
life-chances and capital forms between cities and suburbs. Suburbs benefit on average
from a higher capital z-score than do cities. For example, a suburban sector ’s average z-
score in cultural capital is 1.73 times that of a city ’s, and this difference is statistically
significant at the 95% level. These gaps support the hypothesis that suburbanites benefit
from ample and diverse capital resources more than do many of their urban counterparts.
At the same time, the results support the hypothesis that inhabitants of the suburbs alsoTable 4. Factor analysis of life-chances: major factorsaand factor loading (KMO = 0.656).

Results of the linear multiple regression models
In the last stage of the study, we employed multiple regression models in order to examine
the effect of different accumulations of capital on life-chances, while controlling for the
formation of urban entities (city vs. suburb). The weighted index of life-chances (depen-
dent variable) was then regressed on the independent variables (economic, cultural, and
social forms of capital), which are closely intertwined in these models ( Table 6 ). The R2
range between 62% and 77% reveals that the four models performed well in explaining
life-chances in space.
As expected, different capital resources have for the most part a positive and sig-
nificant association with the life-chances weighted index. The results indicate that social
groups within the Israeli central region that benefit from high values of economic, social,
and cultural capital resources also enjoy greater opportunities and capabilities to improve
their quality of life. However, the factor of “Municipal Input of Social Bonding ”in
models C and D suggests an opposite relationship. That is, the higher the municipality ’s
performance in this regard in a given locality, the lower is the expectation that its
inhabitants will be exposed to capabilities and life-chances. This negative linkage is not
surprising, though, given its role in producing or depressing social capital as was
discussed previously in the section on measuring capital forms and life-chances. The
results here coincide with Putnam ’s(2007 ) observation that immigration and ethnic
diversity tend to reduce social solidarity and social capital. Therefore, in the case of the
Tel Aviv metropolitan region, social diversity does not relate to equity, thus confirming
Susan Fainstein ’s(2010 ) concern that these two concepts of her “Just City ”model might
contradict each other.15
Furthermore, of the four models tested, models A and D are stronger, since the effect
of the independent variables is statistically highly significant at the 95% or 99% level,Table 5. Differences in capital resources accumulation and life-chances between cities and suburbs

Dependent variable in all models —life-chances weighted index.
Source: Authors ’analysis of Israel Bureau of Statistics data and other sources as described in the text.594 E. Israel and A. Frenkelwhile the effect of some of the independent variables in the other two models, B and C, is
statistically significant at a more moderate level —90%.
Controlling for the factors entered into the models allowed an examination of the net
effect of an inhabitant ’s location (a city or a suburb) on the prediction of the life-chances
weighted index. We can see, for example, that the dummy variable in models A, B, and C,
which differentiates between cities (defined as 0) and suburban local authorities (defined
as 1), has a significant and positive influence on life-chances. That is, the more suburban
the entity, the more its inhabitants will benefit from meaningful capabilities to be socially
mobilized. In model D, the ln form of the population size was used instead of the dummy
variable. This continuous variable shows a negative relationship between the population
size of a municipality and life-chances. These results, too, confirm the hypothesis that
suburban inhabitants benefit from more ample and diverse capital resources than do many
of their urban counterparts.
The contribution of the variables to a model ’s general level of explanation is demon-
strated in Table 7 , in which a stepwise method was employed. We can see that the factor
of“Social Bonding ”in models A and B contributes the most to the explanation of the
variance. In model C, the major contribution is ascribed to the dummy variable, “Cities vs.
Suburbs, ”while the “Population Size (ln) ”factor contributes the largest explanatory
proportion in model D. The results arising from models A and B are consistent with
recent studies from the United States, for example, that indicated that social cohesion was

urban entities (see, e.g., Brueckner & Largey, 2008 ; Williamson, 2010 ).
It is interesting to note that even after controlling for the other variables, the economic
forms of capital make relatively less of a contribution to the prediction of life-chances.
This finding supports the theoretical argument underlying the current study, that probing
only economic variables might conceal other capital forms explaining the existence of
equality of opportunity in space. Therefore, the regression results seem to indicate that
equal opportunity is not only about money and material assets but also about more
abstract forms of social and cultural resources. Still, it seems from the regressions applied
that even the cultural capital factors that were entered into the models made a relatively
less meaningful contribution to life-chances, than the other capital factors.
Conclusions
The current research regarding the social costs of intense suburbanization processes
admittedly suffers from a lack of empirical evidence that could directly support or reject
the arguments raised in discussions of this phenomenon. The literature on this inquiry has
tended to overlook the philosophical notion of the meaning of justice. Instead, simplistic
measures are proposed that capture an overall or aggregate construct of resources, mainly
economic in nature. Such an approach, as this paper has argued, neglects the intricacies
concealed in different resources that facilitate the achievement of different goals.
The current study presents an initial endeavor to convert the abstract notion of justice, as
conceived in the liberal stream of thought, into an entity subject to empirical examination,
one in which the social disparities engendered by suburbanization and sprawl could be
better measured and understood. Unfortunately, the theory of justice does not supply a
metric scale or a numerical cutoff point below which, for example, the situation would be
considered unjust and above which it would be considered just. Using measurements of
capital assets as suggested in this study may contribute to producing a metric-like scale of
justice. Different variables have been employed in several other studies in the past in order
to measure spatial differences in capital accumulation (see, e.g., Gatrell, Popay, & Thomas,
2004 ). However, the added value of the present study emanates from an exploration of the
extent and variance to which people are exposed to a set of life-chances across space as a
function of capital accumulation. Taking this approach, the present work hopes to shed
some light on the circumstances that can be depicted as either just or inequitable.
The empirical results revealed that fundamental spatial gaps in the measured value of
the three Bourdieuian forms of capital exist between cities and suburbs in the Tel Aviv
metropolitan region. These results imply that suburban inhabitants benefit from a larger
accumulation of economic, cultural, and social capital assets than do urban inhabitants. In
addition, the results indicate that suburban inhabitants benefit from larger capabilities
(represented by the life-chances weighted index developed in the study) than do city
inhabitants to advance up the social ladder. The extent of these accumulations, which are
expressed in the variables put forth to measure capital assets, seems to differ significantly
between cities and suburbs. This finding confirms our research hypothesis regarding the
city–suburb cleavage. Surprisingly, economic capital was found to be a relatively weak
predictor of life-chances compared, for example, to social capital. Now the question is,
does this unequal distribution of resources and opportunities in space create spatial
injustice?
The study examined suburbanization, not necessarily as the primary driver of funda-
mental social inequalities, but as an important vehicle by which inequalities might be596 E. Israel and A. Frenkelextended over time and as an important product of fundamental social inequalities. Since
equality of opportunity (or capabilities) is one of the indicators of social justice (Rawls,
1971 ; Sen, 1992 ), the gaps identified probably lead to spatial segregation and deprivation
and, therefore, to social injustice in the Tel Aviv metropolitan region.
Regression models were employed to confirm this contention. These models revealed
direct relationships between capital accumulations and capabilities. The dependency of
life-chances on the extent of accrued economic, cultural, and social capital was proven by
the existence of a significant statistical association between capital and life-chances
indices. The unequal accumulation of capital resources between suburban and city
inhabitants probably influences the capabilities of the former to lead or more freely
choose one form of life or another. Without these capabilities, they would not be able
to execute their freedom to achieve different functionings (Robeyns & Brighouse, 2010 ), a
situation that could hurt the distribution of real equal opportunities in space. In accordance
with this theoretical construct, the current spatial distribution of goods would seem to be
unjust in the region studied, because it depicts unequal opportunity conditions among
different forms of settlements. That said, it should be borne in mind that this relationship
is an evolutionary process that may further deepen and perpetuate injustice. The explana-
tion for this eventuality follows.
In Bourdieu ’s theoretical rationale, being disadvantaged leads to an unconscious
acceptance of domination, thus conceding larger ambitions or constraining mental cap-
abilities from flourishing beyond a relative position. Sen describes this pattern of thinking
as“capability failure ”(Bowman, 2010 ); that is, it reinforces deprivation and social
classification for many of the least advantaged in the cities, in contrast to the affluent,
who reside in distinctive suburbs. A cruel cycle is produced, since the ability of indivi-
duals to accumulate capital, and thus determine their position in a given social space (i.e.,
class stratification), is adversely affected. For example, capability failure shapes the
context in which the next generation of many of the worst-off communities in the cities
is reared. Under this theorization, offspring inherit understandings of what it means to
occupy a particular social space, thereby legitimizing the same divisions as their parents ’
capabilities and, hence, their own future functionings (Sayer, 2011 ; Skeggs, 1997 ).
Of course, the evolutionary depiction of power relationships in space might stimulate
the question of cause and effect. That is, does possession of various forms of capital drive
residential location? Or does location lead to the acquisition of these forms? We cannot
answer the question at this time, but the speculation is that immigrating to the suburbs
would be impossible without a sufficient amount of economic capital. Moreover, without
sufficient cultural capital or even social capital, an individual or family would find it
difficult to be absorbed and assimilated in communities that are highly distinctive in
nature as many Israeli suburbs are.
One more important point implied by the results of the study is the fact that they seem
to be opposed to concepts promoting the diversification of cities as a measure of justice
(Fainstein, 2010 ; Sandercock, 1998 ). In contrast to recent urban-utopian theories, personal
capabilities are negatively related to social heterogeneity. This finding complements the
argument that diversity actually contradicts to some degree the concept of equity (Florida,
2002 ) or democracy (Harvey, 1997 ; Putnam, 2007 ). This outcome is being realized under
deepening suburbanization, thus removing even further the possibility of obtaining social
justice in space.
Beyond adding to theoretical meanings, the study enlarges the methodological scope
of similar inquiries in the past. It allows us to think big, by measuring larger entities, while
thinking small, by measuring the very mechanisms that influence a person ’s liberty. In thisUrban Geography 597regard, our approach departs from previous studies. To start with, it expands the geogra-
phical scale and scope usually applied in Bourdieu-inspired urban research, which focuses
mainly on small and medium scales (see, e.g., Bridge, 2006 ; Podmore, 1998 ). The present
study also goes beyond the usual quantification of segregation and housing distinctions,
which use regular indices of dissimilarity along lines of race, ethnicity, religion, or class.
The latter kind of analysis is predetermined by and large by more immediately observable
spatial units, such as statistical areas or census tracts, and is limited to the set of variables
that are collected there (Lee et al., 2008 ; Reardon et al., 2008 ; Wong, 2003 ). The current
study disconnects this linkage, thus enabling a broadening of the epistemological and
methodical possibilities for this type of study.
It seems, then, that the spatial methodology proposed here enables a measurement of
complex social spaces. The use of different measurements not associated with one another
(i.e., low correlation coefficients) reflects this complexity. That social space is complex is
indicated by the fact that various municipalities in the region are ranked differently in the
capital accumulation hierarchy for each form of capital examined. This implies that space
in the Tel Aviv metropolitan region is fractured and heterogeneous, that residents in
different forms of settlements are dispersed across a social space that warps the visible
physical space. The complexity of Tel Aviv ’s social space described here coincides with
Marom ’s(2014 ) recent study, which shows that this metropolitan area has been greatly
influenced by spatial practices of segregation and differentiation, manifesting historical –
cultural changes and the turbulence of political-economic systems in regard to ethno-
national conflict.
These new insights of the current study have the potential, for example, to assist
policy-makers in formulating local policies that advance sustainability. The economic,
cultural, and social assets that people accumulate and reproduce act as human resources
and are available to localities and regions. As such, they could be utilized to determine
regional “Development Engines ”—to develop economic, social, and political bases that
could promote the interests of a growing number of social segments in the metropolitan
space. Based on the indices developed in this study, local authorities could initiate sets of
capital resources that would enable their inhabitants to improve their life-chances from the
outset, thereby constituting an initial step toward the alleviation of spatial injustice.
However, it should be remembered that the interpretations attached to the current
study need to be examined with the awareness of its limitations. To start with, the
definitions of capital and capabilities depend upon the set of variables determined by
the researchers. Therefore, the social space comprising the three forms of capital is
structured by the variables selected (Gatrell et al., 2004 ). Future studies that will be
based on the combinations of the variables suggested here may provide a more reasonable
representation of the social space in the Tel Aviv metropolitan region, as well as in the
metropolitan regions of other Western countries. In this context, one should bear in mind
that the Tel Aviv metropolitan region experienced the same path of urban sprawl as many
other Western metropolises, and is characterized by a similar path of disurbanization and
functional decentralization (Frenkel, 2007 ; Razin et al., 2007 ). This is not surprising,
though, if one considers the laissez-faire virtue that has adhered to Israel ’s spatial
development over the past 25 years, and the country ’s general political climate, which
embraces privatization and rejects overregulation. It seems, then, that the current inquiry
could serve as a representative case study of many other metropolitan regions in the
Western hemisphere. Nevertheless, it is still a case study, and therefore its findings need to
be enlarged by other case studies in order to validate the theory proposed.598 E. Israel and A. FrenkelFurthermore, the municipal level explored here might be quite limited in itself. Large
metropolitan data sets refer to the averages of very heterogeneous entities, such as cities
(and even some suburbs), that reflect the data complexity of the Tel Aviv region. The
methods used in this study are set within the context of the Bourdieuian perspective,
which offers an appropriate basis from which such analyses might proceed. For example,
future research could collect data on capital resources and personal capabilities at the level
of individuals and their families, thus modifying the drawbacks associated with the
metropolitan level.

Notes
1. Even though the capability approach can be understood to be individualistic, it does account
for social relations and the constraints imposed on and opportunities offered to individuals by
societal structures and institutions (Robeyns, 2005 ). Capabilities represent a concept of human
well-being, reflecting social and environmental factors that influence the conversions of
commodities into functionings and taking into account the influence of societal structures
and constraints on a person ’s choices. Thus, economic exploitation, racism, oppression, and
discrimination are already taken into account in the conversion of a capability set into real
functionings (Drèze & Sen, 2002 ).
2. In contrast to formal liberty or negative liberty. The latter means the freedom of the social
subject from any formal constraints. For further reading regarding the theoretical foundations
of the two concepts of liberty, positive and negative, see Berlin ( 1970 , pp. 118 –172).
3. Spatial justice refers to institutions, policies, discourse, and practices involved in formulating
the organization of space, thus shaping just and unjust human interactions across it (Soja,
2010a ). Social practices (under this Neo-Lefebvrian theorization regarding the “Production of
Space ”) eventually produce social arrangements that conceal the asymmetry of power relations
in this space.
4. Measurement in the current study relies on the developing practice of operationalizing Sen ’s
approach in a set of empirical studies (e.g., Anand, Hunter, & Smith, 2005 ; Krishnakumar &
Ballon, 2008 ). Major international institutions, foremost among them the United Nations,
developed the Human Development Index (HDI) (UNDP 1990 –2008) to measure capabilities
according to Sen ’s theorization. This is definitely one of the few instances in the social
sciences of transforming a conceptual perception of justice to a measurable subject.
5. Bourdieu ’s tripartite understanding of capital has been heavily quantified during the past two
decades, first and foremost by Bourdieu ( 1986a ) himself in his seminal book Distinction ,
which ignited a vast literature that measured his theory empirically in different sociological
contexts (see, e.g., Robson & Sanders, 2010 ). However, most of these studies did not measure
his concept in the spatial perspective.
6. Regional councils in Israel are one of the three types of local government entities and Israeli-
administered territories with the other two being cities and local councils. Regional council is
usually responsible for governing a number of settlements spread across rural areas, and is
usually scattered over a relatively large area within geographical vicinity of each other.
7. Besides fierce suburbanization, the last two decades witnessed a renewed convergence into the
inner parts of the Tel Aviv metropolis (Frenkel, 2007 ). This counter sprawl reflects, inter alia,
urban renewal processes (gentrification), which are evolving mainly in the metropolitan core,
the city of Tel Aviv. Like many gentrified cities in the Western world (Smith, 1996 ), Tel Aviv ’s
urban renewal expresses the evolution of new urban life styles of socially and spatially mobile
young groups seeking to be distinct from the suburban middle class mainly by relocating to the
historic heart of the city (Marom, 2014 ). This phenomenon, being beyond the subject of the
current paper, calls for its own inquiry.
8. These 59 municipalities represent all the local authorities that exist in the region, except for
seven Arab municipalities (constituting 3.5% of the total population of the metropolis inUrban Geography 5992008). For the purpose of this study, the inclusion of these Arab local authorities was not
relevant, since no Arab cities have developed similar suburbs as appears in the Jewish sector.
No new Arab towns or localities have been established in Israel since its inception. (Only a
small number of communities recognized later, not at the Tel Aviv metropolitan region.) As a
result, the development of the Arab urban structure is different from the Jewish. The pattern of
development in the Arab urban structure does not include the formation of cities and suburbs
thus is not relevant for the discussion on the subject of social capital and inequality in the
context of cities –suburb cleavages.
9. In order to probe the normative social contentions against urban sprawl, we preferred a simple
typology that differentiated between cities and suburbs, rather than a progressive division of
the metropolitan space.
10. Main factors were defined by eigenvalues >1.
11. Dominant measures were defined as those with an absolute value of a component coefficient
greater than 0.5. These measures were taken from the Rotated Component Matrix table
produced from the Principal Components procedure by the Varimax method of rotation.
12. Human capital is conceived in this paper as an outcome of Bourdieuian capital resources, thus
serving as a product of investment ensuing from these forms of capital. Human capital
approaches suggest linear models, in which there is a direct linkage between the investment
in acquiring education/professional knowledge and monetary income (Kalaitzidakis,
Mamuneas, Savvides, & Stengos, 2001 ). Bourdieu capital resources, on the other hand, are
much less linear. The linkage between capital forms and their returns is much more complex,
diverse in its variables, and highly intangible (Bourdieu, 1986b , pp. 243 –244).
13. Home ownership is believed to represent opportunity rather than economic capital, even
though it can be seen as a material asset promoting economic welfare. The first home
owned represents a chance to secure a fixed and stable accommodation, while ensuring an
inheritance for offspring. Owning one ’s own housing is not an exceptional asset in Israel
(Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)). Furthermore, many who own their own homes owe
large mortgages to banks, thus gnawing away their disposable income. In this study, only the
ownership of more than two houses was considered a meaningful economic capital (see
Appendix 1). Multiple ownership of housing might signify additional or enhanced disposable
income, thus broadening the accumulation of economic capital.
14. This logic is based on Galster and Killen ’s(1995 ) definitions of spatial opportunities, accord-
ing to which opportunities are affected, among others, by the individual ’s perceptions and
beliefs regarding his/her capability to make and convert decisions in different fields of life into
economic –social utilities.
15. However, this might result from the effect of scale and measurement. Different geographic
scales produce different outcomes in regard to social networks and a person ’s access to
resources and opportunities. Analyzing social capital at different geographic scales (i.e.,
local, regional, and national) depicts different community and organizational relationships
that enhance or decrease an individual ’s life-chances, depending on which social relationship
the scale of measurement enables capturing (Bebbington, 1999 ). For example, measuring
social capital at the local scale captures the extent to which a community is homogeneous
or heterogeneous, whereas this characteristic is much more difficult to capture at large or
aggregate geographic scales (e.g., metropolitan or regional). Thus, capturing the homogeneity
of social groups along lines of class, race, gender, or other cultural identity enables researchers
to analyze their access to different life-chances; such groups manifest a shared experience and
strong intragroup communication, producing networks of trust and mutual accountability that
might be absent in large, diverse urban entities (for further discussion, see Glover, Parry, and
Shinew ( 2005 ), Ryan ( 2011 ), and Woolcock ( 1998 )).

No. 2625, 2017, pp. 43–50.http://dx.doi.org/10.3141/2625-05Vehicle automation has garnered a significant amount of interest in 
recent years. When the automated driving (AD) capability of a vehicle is assessed, it is important to distinguish between full automation, in which no human driver is required, and partial automation, in which a human driver may be required to intervene or take control of the vehicle occasionally for portions of the trip. This paper presents a method for assessing usage opportunities of partial AD in light-duty vehicle fleets. Key assumptions are that (a ) the longer the time fraction of driving in 
which AD is active, the better, and (b ) drivers will value having longer 
contiguous sections of AD-active time over having to frequently regain vehicle control. Given second-by-second records of real-world driving trips, the method uses a fuzzy inference system to estimate the fraction of driving time at a certain quality-of-use level. Performing the quality-of-use assessment for all trips and vehicles in a representative data set can then provide insight into the fraction of the population that would likely find partial AD desirable. To demonstrate the proposed method, data on vehicle trips from public travel surveys in California (California House-hold Travel Survey) and Atlanta, Georgia (Atlanta Regional Commission Travel Survey), were used along with simplified prototypical models for partial AD. Simulation results were generally in agreement with com-mon perceptions but showed a wide range of possibilities, which could have been narrowed down further when more detailed trip data became  
available.
Automated vehicles are generally defined as those having the capa-
bility to perform the critical safety control functions (steering and speed and braking) for at least a portion of the driving time. Differ -
ent levels of automated driving (AD) have been defined by NHTSA, ranging from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 4 (full self-driving automation) (1). Alternatively, SAE has its own five-level standard (SAE Standard J3016-2014-01), with the primary difference—according to the Stanford Center for Internet and Society—being that full automation (NHTSA Level 4) is further broken down into two sublevels (SAE Levels 4 and 5), depending on whether the AD system is capable of handling all possible environmental driving 
conditions (2 ). The media have shown much interest in full AD 
(Level 4+ ) since the announcement by Google in 2012 (3 ). While 
commercial availability of full AD is much anticipated in the future, Level 2 AD features (often called “partial automation”) are already becoming available in a few high-end vehicle models. Other than a 
fairly recent safety investigation following a traffic accident fatality  
in May 2016, in which a partial AD vehicle was involved, partial AD 
has not had as much media coverage. Barriers to partial AD market penetration could include a push to jump to full AD by some tech-nology developers, as expressed by Google’s self-driving focus and 
advocacy groups such as the National Association of City Transporta-
tion Officials. The association recently released a call to ban partial AD from city streets (and any other nonlimited access roadways) because of safety concerns from driver inattentiveness in partial AD 
scenarios (4 ). Nonetheless, as many luxury features in high-end vehi-
cles eventually trickle down to mass-market vehicles, this research 
presents a method that focuses on gauging the desirability of partial AD for the general populace.
Related WoRk
Several aspects of envisioned full AD have been studied in the lit-
erature. Studies have highlighted issues such as increased safety (5 ), 
shared autonomous vehicles (6, 7 ), various aspects of transporta-
tion energy (8–10), as well as holistic system-level energy implica-tions (11–13). On the socioeconomic side, studies have attempted to quantify potential business opportunities and risks (14, 15 ), while 
other studies attempted to gauge attitudes toward AD via public poll-ing (16, 17 ). The conjectures of studies that attempt to estimate when 
full AD would become the “new norm” range from 2030 and 2040 (18, 19). Only a few studies in the literature, such as MacKenzie et al. 
(13) and Wadud et al. (20), have attempted to assess the effects of the 
adoption of partial AD. Those authors attempted to predict changes in transportation energy in four envisioned scenarios, with two sce-narios involving widespread adoption of partial AD (Levels 2 and 3) and two scenarios involving full AD ( 13, 20). However, the likelihood 
for each scenario becoming reality was not addressed.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, other than polling for pub-
lic attitudes toward AD, there have been no systematic studies in 
the literature that attempt to assess the desirability of partial AD via 
analyzing present-day real-world driving, which is the focus of this 
research.Method for Gauging Usage Opportunities

Scope of WoRk
This paper presents a method for gauging the desirability of partial 
AD apps, focusing on NHTSA/SAE Automation Level 2, in which 
the driver may relinquish complete control of the vehicle for certain 
periods of time, but is required to remain at the steering wheel ready 
to take over control when necessary or when prompted by the vehicle. 
With partial AD being the sole focus of this work, to reduce clutter, 
further mention of “partial AD” will be replaced by just “AD.” Fol-
lowing software terminology, the term “AD app” is used for describ-
ing different regimes in which AD can be activated. Since Level 2 is partial automation, the implication is that the possibility for activat-
ing it is contingent on certain conditions (about the trip and driving) 
being true, and that there could be different AD apps that could be 
activated under different driving conditions. Key assumptions for 
estimating how well an AD app would be valued (from a perspective 
of increased driver convenience) follow:
1. The longer the amount of time (or fraction of total driving 
time) in which the driver can let the vehicle do the driving (i.e., some 
AD app is engaged), the better.
2. The longer the uninterrupted durations in which AD is engaged, 
the better. For example, the possibility of AD remaining engaged without interruptions for 5 min would be valued higher by a driver 
than AD remaining engaged for five 1-min durations.
The proposed method is first introduced in an abstract sense, in 
which the conditions for an AD app to remain active are some generic 
function of the instantaneous driving conditions. Trip logs from real-
world driving are analyzed for contiguous segments in which an AD 
app remains active, and the length of segment durations is translated into “quality of usage” levels.
To demonstrate the proposed method, trip logs from the California 
Household Travel Survey (CHTS) and the Atlanta Regional Com-
mission Travel Survey (ARCTS) are analyzed. In preserving the 
privacy of survey participants, the public data sets, which are hosted 
by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, mask out location-
revealing information, such as GPS coordinates, altitude, and even 
road type (21). With second-by-second vehicle speed available, two 
simplified AD apps are modeled:
1. Highway AD app. It is assumed to be possible to engage this 
app as long as the vehicle speed remains above some threshold.
2. Traffic Jam app. It is assumed to be possible to engage this app 
as long as the vehicle speed remains below some threshold.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section pro-
vides a detailed explanation of the method, followed by a discussion of its application to the CHTS and ARCTS data sets. The geographic 
distribution of the sampled vehicles in the ARCTS data set is then 
examined. The paper concludes with a summary and discussion of future work.
Method
abstract Notations
Data from instrumented vehicles in travel surveys are often arranged 
(or could be arranged) in the form of a collection of recorded trips V
ij(t), where
 i = index for vehicle sample ID (from 1 to N ),
 j = index for trips done by vehicle i (from 1 to m i), t = time at certain instant during trip (between 0 and T ij), and
 V =  monitored indicators at every time step of trip (boldface 
implies this could be a vector of quantities), such as vehicle 
speed, type of road, and traffic conditions.
An abstract logic function φa is defined as an indicator of whether  
it is possible to engage an AD app a  at time instant t  of trip j 
by vehicle i. To reduce reading clutter, indexes i  and j  have been 
dropped from Equations 1 through 3.
:t rue,false( 1) V ttaa {} () () () φ= φ∈
Equation 2 allows the calculation of the duration of time τ ak of an 
event k where AD app a  could have been engaged during the trip 
and remained active without interruption (i.e., AD available):
true (2) tt tt ttak ka kk kf ss f () τ= −φ =∀ ≤≤
where tks, tkf are, respectively, the time instances for start and finish 
of the event k where AD app a could have been engaged.
As previously noted in the assumptions, the quality and desirability 
of an AD event are perceived to improve as the uninterrupted duration 
of the AD app becomes longer. However, setting hard thresholds for 
how long an event needs to be in order to be “good” is not an easy task. For example, if 5 min was set as the threshold, it would make 
little sense that some person would consider 5 min plus 1 s to be good 
but 5 min minus 1 s “not good enough.” The proposed method uses fuzzy sets to provide smooth transitions between thresholds (22). The 
equivalent amount of driving time in a trip at some quality level of 
AD desirability is calculated as
(3) Maa La
kLk k ∑ () Ω= ττ
where
 L =  fuzzy sets for quality levels (e.g., “poor,” “good,” and “very 
good”) of an AD app a,
 k =  summation index for all events in which AD app a  remained 
active without interruption during analyzed trip,
 ML =  fuzzy membership function (value from 0 to 1) for fuzzy 
set L, and
	ΩaL =  total equivalent amount of time at quality level L for AD app a for analyzed trip.
By summing up for all trips recorded for a vehicle sample i, one 
can calculate its fraction of driving time (Γ

AD quality for each AD app a:

Special Implementation for public t ravel  
Survey data Sets
The abstract method notations discussed in the previous subsection 
leave open several specifics, such as what quantities are monitored Laberteaux, Hamza, Berger, and Brown 45
in the instrumented vehicles, actual logic of the function φa(V(t)), 
number and range limits between fuzzy membership functions, as 
well as number and modes of operation for AD apps. This sub section 
provides a specific implementation of all those details, with the intent of demonstrating the proposed method. Key features of the CHTS and ARCTS data sets are listed in Table 1.
As discussed in the section on scope of work, because of pri-
vacy reasons, only the vehicle speed is available in the second-by- second trip records. Despite that, speed could be a reasonable proxy indicator of whether certain driving conditions are in effect. Two simplified models of AD apps are studied, in which engagement opportunity (Equation 1) is defined only as a function of speed, that 
is, φ
a(t) := φa(V(t)) (defining AD availability on the basis of just a 
single parameter, speed, simplifies the exposition of this method; 
however, the authors look forward to refining definitions of AD 
availability when data sets with additional characterizations of the 
driving situation and conditions—for example, visibility, road type, and driver-attentiveness—become available). The modeled AD apps follow:

Four fuzzy sets L ∈ {poor, fair, good, excellent} with trapezoidal 
membership functions are used in this study for quality rating of 
an opportunity for AD app engagement, as shown in Figure 1 (22). 
The thresholds (values at which fuzzy sets begin and end) are an initial guess perceived reasonable by the authors, with sensitivity 
to threshold tuning briefly examined, but with full relationship to 
public opinion deferred to future work.
The way the method is applied to analyze a vehicle sample from 
a travel survey data set is illustrated in Figure 2. Given the speed trace record of some vehicle trip (Figure 2a), speed thresholds are applied to mark the contiguous section of the trip where each AD 
app could be engaged, as shown in Figure 2b.  Next, the duration 
of each contiguous segment is analyzed to calculate an equivalent 
duration at a quality level. For example, the first segment of the highway app lasted 231 s (just shy of 4 min), which per Figure 1a 
translates to membership values of 0.57 and 0.43 in the fuzzy sets 
“fair” and “good,” respectively (and zero membership in all other sets). The 231-s duration of this trip segment is then proportion-
ally allocated (133 s fair and 98 s good) in the bookkeeping of the 
AD quality levels (Figure 2c ) for the highway app. Similarly, the 
second segment of the highway app, which lasted only 10 s, is fully 
allocated to the poor quality level (since it had a membership value 
of 1 in the poor fuzzy set). Finally, repeating the steps of Figure 2, a through c, for all recorded trips of a vehicle allows for estimating 
the net fraction of the vehicle’s driving time at each AD app quality 
level, as illustrated in Figure 2d.

AD cost predictions in the literature are often speculative and exhibit 
quite a bit of uncertainty and disagreement (11, 23–25). Without this 
price information, estimating adoption rates would be very difficult. Results in this study for opportunities to use AD apps are presented as an indicator of plausible AD desirability but should not be inter -
preted as a statistical expected value (especially since there is a fairly TABLE 1  Features of Considered Public Survey Data Sets

large uncertainty range as a result of parameter uncertainty and the 
simplified AD app models). It is assumed that there exists some threshold for the fraction of driving time at good or excellent quality 
of AD use, below which a rational purchaser or driver would not be 
interested in the AD app. Conversely, the number of drivers with a fraction of driving time above the threshold is indicative of whether the AD app could be desirable. Since there are presently no data on 
the desirability limit (which could reasonably vary from one person to another), results presented in this section (Figure 3) are in the form 
of “fraction of vehicles population” corresponding to a “fraction of driving in which the AD app is good.”

app will disengage if the speed falls below 45 mph), while the lower 
speed threshold is more stringent for the traffic jam app. In each sub-plot, the centerline presents results obtained via setting the thresh-
olds for fuzzy membership functions to those in Figure 1, while the 
top and bottom lines (edges of shaded region) represent sensitivity limits for less and more stringent settings of the threshold limits for the “good” fuzzy set. For less stringent settings, the limits for the 
good fuzzy set are scaled to 60% of the values in Figure 1, while the 
more stringent settings scale it up to 160% of the values in Figure 1.  
An example of how to interpret the baseline plot for the highway in the CHTS data set (centerline in top-middle plot in Figure 3) is that 30% of California vehicles (vertical axis value) may engage the 
highway AD app at a “good or excellent” quality level for at least 25% 
(value from the horizontal axis) of their total driving time.
The following are some observations from Figure 3:
•	Despite being thousands of miles apart and with different 
region contents (whole state versus one large metro area), the CHTS 
and ARCTS vehicle samples seem to have similar trends concerning the opportunity to engage AD apps.
•	The fraction of vehicles in the population whose drivers could 
use AD is more sensitive to the operability speed threshold in the case of the traffic jam app. The sensitivity is less in the case of the highway app.
•	The fraction of vehicles in the population whose drivers could 
use the traffic jam app decreases very quickly as the fraction of driv-ing time with a good opportunity to engage the app increases from 5% to 15% and beyond. Very few vehicles have 30% of their total driving time as a good opportunity to engage the traffic jam app.•	The fraction of vehicles in the population whose drivers could 
use the highway app decreases steadily as the fraction of driving time increases, but even at the more stringent limits, there is a rea-sonable fraction of the population of vehicles that could find the app useful.
The level of mental stress of a driver can vary significantly in dif-
ferent modes of driving (e.g., cruising on the highway or stuck in a traffic jam). As a result, it is necessary to consider that drivers may value different AD apps differently. For example, 10% of total driv-
ing time relieved by a traffic jam AD app may well be sufficient for 
a driver to desire it, but 10% of highway driving time relieved may be insufficiently desirable. However, certain conditions that lead to traffic jams (e.g., poor visibility, slippery conditions, and road work) 
are likely to be inappropriate for a Level 2 AD app to be engaged.
effect of GeoGRaphIc locatIoN
Public travel survey data sets protect the identity of survey partici-
pants by redacting home and work addresses, as well as GPS coor -
dinates in trip traces. For the benefit of researchers, however, the data sets provide a rough estimate of home and work location up to some level of geographic resolution. As per Table 1, the geographic resolution is the census tract level for CHTS but only the county level for ARCTS. However, with more than 6,000 census tracts 
in California and only 2,910 instrumented vehicles in CHTS, an 
analysis at the census tract level is clearly infeasible. For a county-level analysis, both data sets have a reasonably good number of vehicle samples per county, but when sample density is considered 
(2,910 vehicles for all of California compared with 1,653 vehicles 
in the greater Atlanta metro area), ARCTS is clearly a geographi-cally denser data set. Furthermore, the counties in the ARCTS data set are conveniently surrounding one major urban core (as shown in Figure  4), allowing for easier contrasting between urban core and 
outlying counties. For those reasons, analysis in this section will consider AD desirability only in the ARCTS data set. Furthermore, though there is a fairly wide range of possibilities shown in Figure 3, TABLE 2  Speed Threshold Limits for Operability of AD Apps

only one example case of the parameter settings is considered, with 
all parameters at the baseline values and considering the following:
•	Ten percent of driving time for the traffic jam app, which cor -
responds to ~24% of ARCTS vehicle samples desiring the app, and
•	Twenty-five percent of driving time for the highway app, which 
corresponds to ~ 28% of the ARCTS vehicle samples desiring the app.
Results for the fraction of vehicles desiring each AD app in each 
county are shown in Figure 5. A distinctive pattern is observed in the 
figure, in which most outer ring counties have a higher percentage of 
vehicles whose drivers would use the highway app. Conversely, most 
counties close to the urban core have a low percentage of desirability 
for the highway app. Such patterns are generally not surprising since 
highways are often the main commuting corridors in the outlying 
counties, while areas closer to the urban core generally have more 
congested traffic and thus fewer opportunities for the highway AD app to remain engaged for long contiguous amounts of time (26 ).
Somewhat expectedly as well, areas close to the urban core have a 
relatively high desirability for the traffic jam app; however, these are not the only areas with a high desirability. Several of the outer ring counties along major highways leading to the urban core have a higher 
opportunity to use the app. This pattern may imply that frequent traffic 
jams are not found exclusively in urban centers. There are also some 
odd-case counties, such as Gwinnett and Cherokee, which are outlying 
counties but are not very high on desirability for the highway app. A possible explanation for Gwinnett and Cherokee may be that those two 
counties have a high within-county job growth and, thus, a relatively 
lower fraction of commuting outside the county (27 ).
coNcluSIoNS
A method for estimating usage opportunity of partial automated 
driving in light-duty vehicle fleets was presented. The method uses 
fuzzy sets to assess quality levels of driver convenience (assuming that longer contiguous time segments with an AD app engaged are 
better) and the fraction of total driving time in which an AD app 
is in good use (i.e., high AD availability). Real-world driving trip 
data from the public travel surveys CHTS and ARCTS were used 
to demonstrate the proposed method. With the limitation that public 
travel surveys provide only the speed of the vehicle, two simplified 
prototypical AD app models were constructed to assess opportunity 
to use partial AD in high- and low-speed regimes. Sensitivity analy-
sis was conducted for (a) the tuning parameters of the fuzzy mem-
bership functions, (b ) speed thresholds for the range of operation 
of the AD apps, and (c) the fraction of drive time at “good” quality 
of use. The ARCTS data set was also used to examine the effect of  
geographic variation (urban core versus outer suburbs). Simulation results agree with common perceptions, such as urban core areas 
seeing more traffic jam conditions and outer suburbs seeing more 
highway-like driving. However, simulation results (and sensitivi-
ties) show a wide range of possibilities for the fraction of the pop-
ulation that could find partial AD desirable. Narrowing down the 
range of estimates would be pursued in future work through three 
thrust efforts: (a ) public polling for how long a “time duration of 
hands off the wheel” would be considered good, (b) public polling for what fraction of driving time relieved by AD would make it 
desirable, and (c) collection of better-quality data sets on real-world driving that would allow more detailed models of partial AD apps 
to be simulated.

The continued and global popularity of single-family homes indicates that a scalable, yet regionally appropriate
strategy for achieving zero-carbon suburban development is needed in the coming decades. This need is espe-cially critical in the hyper-arid region around the Arabian Gulf where per-person carbon emissions are among the
highest in the world. Using geometrically sensitive simulation models for a household's building energy, water,
and automobile use, this paper uses Emirati neighborhoods in Abu Dhabi, UAE as a case study to estimateemissions for a baseline and set of future possible scenarios towards transitioning single-family households in the
region to low, and eventually near-zero operational carbon emissions. An analysis of the combined impact of
energy efficiency gains through (1) technology adoption and better design, (2) carbon intensity reduction fromrenewable energy transitions, and (3) carbon sequestration from parcel scale tree planting is presented. From a
baseline CO
2emissions of 64.3 tons per household per year for new construction, the study finds future emis-
sions potential reductions of 33.7%–49.0% from improved house design, 98.1% from electrification and solar
energy sourcing, and 99.4% from combined design and technology improvements. This study also finds that ifthe water-energy nexus in Abu Dhabi transitioned to solar-powered, reverse-osmosis desalination, trees would
become net carbon sinks (0.6–1.9 kg CO
2/m2/yr). As a result, in the future, low-density neighborhoods with
dense areas of tree planting may become a sustainable housing typology when measured by net operational
emissions. This fact would upend multiple current assumptions by Western planners about sustainable transi-
tions for arid regions.
1. Introduction
The need to transition society to a near-zero carbon future is well
established by scientists and accepted by the majority of city, state, and
national governments [1]. It has also become evident in recent decades
that a majority of these emissions, typically 65%–85%, derive directly
or indirectly from household consumption [2–5]. Comparative studies
have further shown that carbon emission rates tend to be higher for
detached, single-family households due to increased driving and
building energy use [6–9].1In response, the urban planning and design
disciplines have advocated for higher density, walkable, mass-transit
oriented design solutions as the most sustainable housing form [10–12].The reality, however, is that single-family homes continue to be the
housing typology of choice for not only the majority of American fa-
milies [13,14], but for a growing number of families around the world[15,16]. It is imperative, therefore, that if global annual emissions areto rapidly decline over the coming decades, and reach near-zero by the
last half of the century [17–20], scalable, yet regionally-appropriate
strategies for achieving near-zero carbon, single-family households,
must be developed [21].
The need for sustainable single-family household design is espe-
cially critical in the wealthy, hyper-arid region around the Arabian
Gulf, where per-person emissions rates are among the highest in the
world [22]. These emissions are driven in large part by the villa based,
suburban neighborhoods [23,24] in cities of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) nations, which demand significant amounts of energy for
air-conditioning and desalination of water for indoor and landscapinguses [25–27]. Research and design of low (and zero) carbon housing in
this region is less developed than in the West, but the recent con-
struction of several sustainable prototypes in the region highlights a

1There is increasing debate in the planning literature around this topic. A number of recent studies have shown emissions rates of low-density and high-density
housing to be nearly identical or even lower for low-density housing (Du et al., 2016; Perkins et al., 2009).Building and Environment 147 (2019) 77–96

Tburgeoning field.
This paper, using the suburban Emirati villa neighborhoods in Abu
Dhabi as a case study, seeks to answer the question of how single-family
house typologies in a hyper-arid region can achieve near-zero carbon
operational emissions, or even carbon-neutrality.
This study aims to extend the empirical work already being done in
this region through built prototype houses in the following key ways:
•Integrate the three primary operational energy (OE) uses driven by
household scale activity: (1) building cooling, plug, and equipment
loads; (2) water desalination, pumping, and heating; and (3) auto-
mobile driving – collectively referred to as BWA.
•Normalize OE to operational carbon emissions (OC) for each BWAcomponent and, where appropriate, by the number of trees required
to offset emissions (TO).
•Investigate the relative and combined impact of technology-basedsolutions versus design-based solutions.
This paper describes the history of Abu Dhabi's Emirati neighbor-
hood development and provides an overview of research for (1) low-
energy and net-zero villa typologies in the region, (2) advances in solar
photovoltaic technology (PV), and (3) the current state of neighborhood
carbon sequestration studies. Next, it describes the methodology and
materials used to define and simulate scenarios aimed at lowering
household OE and OC. The OC results of each scenario is summarized
for each BWA component, as well as the total aggregate household
emissions, net energy production of the household, and TO require-
ments for achieving zero-carbon operations. The discussion section
begins with limitations and future research. Next, the use of trees as a
metric for carbon offsetting and the resulting future role of landscape
design in the region is discussed. Finally, the relative costs of transi-
tioning to low-carbon technologies and the efficacy of current building
standards in Abu Dhabi is described.
2. Background2.1. Neighborhood development
GCC cities have seen an explosion of urban growth since the 1950's
due to the discovery of hydro-carbon reserves in the region. Often re-
ferred to as ‘manufactured’ urbanization, development in these cities
was largely influenced by Western planning and design models, in-
cluding urban grids and low-density residential neighborhoods [28,29].
Initially built by oil companies, the villa neighborhood typology con-
sists of large, individually walled plots (1000–2000 m
2or more) with
detached, single-family homes. This housing form rapidly became the‘ideal’ and ‘modern’ model that local communities aspired to, and
serves as the dominant typology for Emirati housing today [30]. The
preference for villas remains robust in the GCC [31]. In terms of total
housing share, villas constituted roughly 30% of new construction in
Dubai and 60% in Sharjah from 2003 to 2011 (by floor area) [32]. In
Abu Dhabi specifically, villa-based neighborhoods occupy over 55% of
the current built-area (author calculation based on GIS data) (Fig. 1).
Considering that villa typologies are such a highly preferred residential
typology in the region, ensuring that villa households can achieve low-
carbon futures is critical towards lowering national carbon footprints
and maximizing the utilization of land for productive purposes.
2.2. Low-energy villas
Design and testing of low and near-zero carbon single-family home
typologies has been underway in the Western context for many decades
[33–36]. Low-energy housing in the Arabian Peninsula has a shorter
history, but a number of prototypes have recently been built, including
the SQU EcoHouse (2011) in Oman, the Baytna-Qatar Villa (2012) in
Qatar [37], and the EcoVilla in Masdar City [38]. Regionally specificenergy standards have also been developed, including Estidama by the
Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council (2013), which requires all new
villa's to meet Pearl 1 standards within the five Pearl rating system
[39].
2.3. Advances in solar technology + potential for carbon sequestration
The transition towards low and zero-carbon housing in hyper-arid
regions is aided by two environmental conditions. First, a high insola-
tion rate of 2100 W/m
2/year with an average of at least 11 h of sunlight
per day, provides consistent solar electricity [40]. Recent improvementsin solar panel manufacturing has brought emission factors down to
∼10 g CO
2/kWh [41], with ∼5 g CO 2/kWh likely in the near-term
[42]. For comparison, the current emission factor for grid electricity inAbu Dhabi is 470 g CO
2/kWh [43]. Solar is also rapidly becoming the
cheapest energy source in the region, with recent bids going below$0.02/kWh for utility scale projects [44,45], far less than the $0.08/
kWh required to produced fossil-fuel based electricity for the current
grid [46]. This price discrepancy and environmental advantage has led
to recent initiatives such as Dubai's Clean Energy Strategy 2050, which
seeks 75% energy from solar by 2050 and mandates roof-top solar in-
stallations [47]. Second, the lack of pre-existing vegetation within
suburban Emirati neighborhoods results in large open spaces which
could be planted with fast-growing trees to capture carbon [48–51].
When supplied with water from solar-powered, reverse-osmosis desa-
lination plants (SRO), trees have the potential for significant net carbon
sequestration relative to OC, as this paper will demonstrate. Studies of
net carbon fluxes from existing neighborhoods have found that cur-
rently vegetation (tree, grass, soil) only captures 1%–4% of emissions
[52–54]. Missing in these papers, however, is a calculation of potential
emission reductions from better housing design and technological
transitions. This paper aims to fill this gap, by testing likely scenarios
for future household scale emission reduction and carbon sequestration
together.
3. Materials and methods
This study has three phases. The first phase sets eight total scenarios
– six current and two future scenarios – that test the potential impact of
improved design and/or technology towards transitioning to low or
near-zero carbon household operations. The second phase runs each
scenario's parameters through validated simulation models to estimate
carbon emissions. Sequestration rates for each scenario are based on
empirical research. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted. The third
phase briefly considers the economic and regulatory feasibility of im-
plementing the proposed technologies and design changes.

783.1. Existing and future low-carbon scenarios
The first phase of the study involved establishing scenarios which
could be reasonably compared to one another to understand the relative
impact factors of future technology and design on operational carbon
emissions at the household scale. We defined three technological sce-
narios (T1, T2, T3) to test the impact of technology alone on net
emissions. Two formal house design and thermostat set-point scenarios
(D1, D2) were then combined with each technology scenario for six
total scenarios (S1 through S6). The key parameter categories, stan-
dards, and technologies assumed for each scenario are shown inTable 1. See Appendix A for a comprehensive list of parameters and
values.
3.1.1. Technology scenarios
The first technology option (T1) used Estidama standards for con-
struction insulation values, and lighting and appliance efficiency.
Occupant water-use and driving behavior were set using empirical
studies from the region [55,56].
The second technology option (T2) tested the potential emissions
reduction from transitioning from gasoline cars to electric cars and from
natural gas driven multi-stage flash desalination (MSF) to electric pump
driven reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination. All electricity supply was
modelled from roof-top or ground-mounted solar panels plus battery
storage. It was presumed, though not simulated, that households could
perform adequate load-balancing with a 40.5 kWh household battery
system in conjunction with two electric automobile battery systems.

This scenario sets an upper bound in operational carbon emissions that
existing Estidama standards would permit under an electrification
scenario. The third technology option (T3) tested the additional po-
tential (post-electrification) for emissions reductions from efficiency
improvements that meet the Passive House standard [60], namely:
improvements to building façade insulation and air-tightness, more
efficient appliances and fixtures, and replacement of incandescent bulbs
with high-efficiency LEDs.
3.1.2. Design scenarios
Two design options were developed to test the potential impact of
formal house and landscape design parameters which define the villa
typology. These include house size, window size and location, tree
number and location, and thermostat set-point. The latter is included as
it is a primary behavioral parameter that interacts with room size and
solar gain in a space to determine overall human comfort [61,62]. The
design parameters were combined with the three technology scenariosto test the combined impact of technology and formal design on netcarbon emissions.
The first design option (D1) set a baseline that adheres to Estidama
Pearl 1 Rating Standards for window-to-floor ratio. Floor area per
person was set using the upper range of average house sizes in Emirati
neighborhoods [63] divided by the average family size. Given the
abundance of houses in Abu Dhabi with few to no shade trees, the D1
scenario assumed no landscaping. The second design option (D2) re-
duced floor area to the lower bound found in Emirati neighborhoods
and set window-to-floor ratio to a lower limit defined by daylighting
studies from similar contexts [64]. Thermostat temperature was raised
from 22 to 24 C.
Both design options assumed a two-story, rectangular form, with
1–1.5 ratio of width to length. This provides a generic form, generally
applicable to arid regions.
3Fig. 2 shows the building and landscape
design for both scenarios. The house is conservatively oriented withlonger exposures faced East-West, which generates the maximum solar
heat-gain [65].
Throughout the technology and design options, the amount of ap-
pliance usage and driving behavior was unaltered. This allowed the
authors to study the potential impact of technology and design alone,
with no changes to the lifestyle of the family, except those imposed by
living in a smaller than average house, though house size remained
within typical ranges found in Emirati neighborhoods.
3.1.3. Special Scenarios
Two final scenarios were simulated which modified previous sce-
narios. The first Special Scenario (SS1) tested the impact of future im-
provements to solar panel manufacturing in the form of higher effi-
ciency (21%) and lower carbon factor (6 g CO
2/kWh) [42,66,67]. This
change was applied to S3, the first full electrification scenario. It testedthe benefit of improving the carbon factor of solar-PV production in-
stead of improving building insulation, appliances, and other technol-
ogies which are seen in S6, and are likely costlier to implement. By
extension, this scenario also tested whether current Estidama regula-
tions are stringent enough to allow for a transition to low carbon villa
designs assuming electrification of desalination and automobile pro-
pulsion and future reductions to the solar-PV carbon factor.
The second Special Scenario (SS2) tested for the same solar panelTable 1

80improvements as S1, plus the following additional improvements that
are reasonably likely in the near future:
•Space per person lowered by an additional 20%, from 50 to 40 m2.4
•Equipment load lowered by 25% from 3.9 to 2.9 w/m2[69].
•RO desalination energy factor lowered from 4.0 to 2.0 kWh/m3
water, the projected level of “near-horizon” improvement potential
using hybrid approaches [70].
•Embodied carbon (EC) from battery production reduced by 45%from 14.5 to 8 kg/hh/yr, in line with the solar carbon factor re-
duction.
3.2. Energy, water, and transport models
The method used in this study aims to understand the relationship
between factors of climate, house and landscape design, and tech-nology. Emissions resulting from household members’ daily activities
are calculated irrespective of the specific geographic location of emis-
sions. This method differs from more strict metabolism studies that use
a discrete spatial boundary to limit measurements of carbon fluxes
[71,72]. Our approach, used successfully in previous studies of house-
hold scale metabolism [73,74], allows a clearer understanding of what
activities are responsible for a given emission source, where they ori-
ginate from, and thus how best to reduce that emission. That said, this
paper does not offer a full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study, and the
results should be considered in light of this. Final emissions calculated
in this study include:
1. CO
2emissions from direct energy use for building air-conditioning,
lighting, and equipment use, excluding transmission losses.
2. CO 2emissions from direct energy use for the desalination and dis-
tribution of potable water and for hot-water heating, includinghousehold leakage and municipal distribution losses.3. CO
2emissions from direct energy use for daily automobile use.
Seasonal, intercity train, bus, and plane travel is ignored.
4. CO 2emissions from the manufacturing of solar-panels and lithium-
ion batteries for household scale storage (embodied emissions).
All models were simulated using Python coded components in
Grasshopper for Rhinoceros, allowing geometrically explicit simula-
tions for building size, shape, window areas, and tree shading.5
3.2.1. Building energy
EnergyPlus was used for building energy simulation including
heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and plug-and-process loads. It has
been validated and is in continual development by the US Department
of Energy [75–77]. The open-source toolset and middle-ware Ladybug
and Honeybee was used within Grasshopper to generate, run, and re-
turn results from EnergyPlus files [78,79]. Heating was ignored as most
houses in Abu Dhabi do not have heating systems due to the hot cli-
mate. In the result section, plug and process loads were combined under
equipment loads, while ventilation, fan, and pump energy loads were
combined under cooling loads.
3.2.2. Potable water + how-water heating
Ninety-nine percent of potable water in Abu Dhabi comes from
desalinated sources [80]. For this sector, the total energy intensity was
calculated using the following parameters:
•direct energy for desalination
•conveyance energy and water-mains losses
•appliance or fixture efficiency (liter per use or minute of flow)
•appliance use rate (cycles or minutes of use per person per day)

France, Spain, Italy, Sweden, though below the United States, Canada, and
Australia [68].5Grasshopper is a visual scripting environment which allows three-dimen-
sional digital user inputs from Rhinoceros 3D to be used in numeric simulations(through Python's math functions), as well to be converted for calls to externalsoftware packages. Rhinoceros 3D is an industry standard three-dimensional
modelling software package used by architects, landscape architects, and urban
designers.D. Birge, A.M. Berger Building and Environment 147 (2019) 77–96
81•household appliance and faucet leakage rate
Parameter values for desalination and conveyance were con-
servatively estimated from currently operating systems [81,82]. Ap-
pliance efficiency rates were set using Estidama standards or currently
available technologies depending on scenario. Occupant usage rates
were set using a detailed study of 151 households in Abu Dhabi using
flow sensors [56].
Hot-water energy demands were calculated using the Water Heater
Analysis Model (WHAM) [83]. It was assumed that all water for dish-
washing, clothes washing, showers, and half of the faucet water was
used at 40 C. Water main temperature was calculated using the algo-
rithm developed by Christensen and Burch [84] and implemented in
Honeybee/Ladybug. A mixing ratio of hot-water and water from the
municipal supply-system was pre-calculated to determine the water
volume drawn from the hot-water tank to achieve a typical desired
temperature at the fixture [85,86].
Water use for solar panel cleaning, while historically a source of
additional water demand in the MENA region, was ignored in this study
due to recent improvements in both water [87] and non-water [88,89]
based cleaning systems. Studies have found that brushing or blowing is
effective for cleaning panels in the MENA region [90].
3.2.3. Daily automobile use
Energy required for daily automobile use was calculated using the
following parameters:
•average distance travelled per-person per-day
•average automobile occupancy rate
•automobile energy-efficiency rating
Data for transportation behavior was derived from a travel survey
conducted in 2009 [55]. Average travel times by gender and age were
used in conjunction with household demographics to estimate average
travel distance per member for a typical Emirati family [91]. Car oc-
cupancy rates were not available for Abu Dhabi so the United States
occupancy rate was substituted.
3.2.4. Solar + battery carbon
A key feature of this study is using the latest carbon emissions factor
from recent solar panel manufacturing studies. First Solar Series 6 pa-
nels have been independently tested to generate 11 g CO 2/kWh sup-
plied [41,92,93]. Carbon emissions for lithium-ion battery productionis also rapidly declining due to improvements in manufacturing pro-
cesses and the use of renewable energy sources. Because battery system
sizing and micro-grid modelling is outside the scope of this study, thisstudy uses Tesla's recommended sizing for a large house. While net-
metering would be required during portions of the year, this does not
impact net carbon emissions from on-site solar systems per the carbon
accounting principles defined by The National Renewable Energy La-
boratory's Net-Zero Energy Buildings [94].
Results from lithium-ion battery manufacturing emissions studies
still vary widely, from 38 to 356 kg C0
2-eq/kWh [95,96]. This study
assumed the following parameters when calculating battery embodiedcarbon emissions:
•conservative (high) energy demands of 587 MJ/kWh for cradle-to-
gate manufacturing [97].
•all mining and manufacturing processes electrified and suppliedfrom solar energy with a carbon factor of ∼30 g CO
2/kWh [98,99].
•gate-to-consumer transportation emissions ignored as they representless than 1% of total emissions [100].
3.2.5. Carbon sequestration from trees
Net carbon sequestration from trees is possible in a coastal, arid
environment when the water used for irrigation is supplied from SRO.
To determine the average net sequestration from a group of typically
occurring trees in Abu Dhabi, we selected nine species present in both
Abu Dhabi's Public Realm Design Manual [101] and the U.S. Forest
Service's CUFR Tree Carbon Calculator [102]. Abu Dhabi's reference
evapotranspiration (ETo) of 2437 mm/year was calculated for the cli-
mate station at Abu Dhabi International Airport (54.65 longitude, 24.43
latitude, 27, altitude) using the FAO's ClimWat 2.0 and ETo 3.2 soft-
ware [103,104]. Yearly water demand and resulting energy demand for
RO desalination was calculated for a twenty year old specimen for each
tree species using the Water Use Classification of Landscape Species
(WUCOLS) method [105]. Net emissions (sequestration) was calculated
as gross emissions from water desalination and pumping minus the
carbon sequestered by the tree (Appendix B).
3.2.6. Energy + carbon balance
Energy demands and emissions for each BWA component were
calculated first. The combined emissions for BWA was then aggregated
to determine the total sequestration required to offset emissions for
each scenario (Table 5). Finally, the additional energy needed for SRO
to water trees for sequestration is added to total household energy
demands, and a final calculation of the required space for solar-PV to
match all demands is made (Appendix D). This calculation is done for
each of the eight total scenarios. Table 6 provides a simple, single-factor
sensitivity analysis of the major input parameters for S6. The authorsset upper and lower bounds using reasonable assumptions for variance
based on the parameters’ characteristics and degree of certainty to

4. Results
The results for each individual BWA sector are discussed first to
highlight the key parameters driving lower carbon emission values in
each area (Tables 2–4). The aggregated OC results are then discussed in
relation to tree sequestration (Table 5).
4.1. Disaggregated results
4.1.1. Building energy (BE)
Taken individually the impact of (1) housing design, (2) insulation
and technology efficiency, and (3) solar-PV energy sourcing can reduce
OC by 53% (S1 to S2),657% (S3 to S5), and 97% (S1 to S3) respectively.
Replacing fossil-fuel based grid electricity with solar-PV electricity isclearly the most important factor in reducing emissions from building
energy use. That said, housing design parameters such as shading,
window-placement and size, and efficient use of space still have a roleto play in lowering BE per person and thus OC as well (see 5.6 for
further discussion). This study also indicates that as new technologies
are implemented across all of the BWA sectors, the share of OC from BE
may rise to as high as 89%, with building cooling being the dominant
factor. Therefore, energy efficient housing design will remain a key
strategy towards achieving near-zero household carbon strategies. Re-
ducing energy use also lowers the number of panels and battery storage
needed to meet power requirements, thus decreasing embodied emis-
sions, material intensities, and increasing the ability to meet all op-
erational energy needs with low-carbon renewables.
4.1.2. Indoor water (WE)
Recent improvements to water appliance efficiencies (S3/S4 to S5/
S6) can reduce water use and hence emissions by 68%, and offers an
immediate, near-term solution to reducing emissions from household
water use. However, a much more significant reduction in emissions of
99.6% results from transitioning to solar-PV supplied RO (SRO) (S1 to
S3). When combined, high-efficiency appliances and SRO reduces
emissions by 99.8% (S1 to S5). This reduction significantly over-shadows the limited (∼5%) potential to reduce water use based emis-
sions through behavioral modifications [106–108]. It should be noted
that all desalination plants currently under construction or planned in
the future will use RO processes [109]. Furthermore, there is reason to
believe this trend will likely continue indefinitely until a full transition
occurs, as RO is cheaper to produce and does not have the energyTable 3

4.1.3. Automobile (A)
The ability of solar-powered electric vehicles to reduce carbon
emissions by 98.5% (from S1 to S4), without any change to drivingbehavior, suggests that near-term policies aimed at carbon reduction
from driving should focus on supporting the rapid transition to electric
vehicles [114,115]. These policies could supplement a longer-term
strategy towards lowering automobile dependence and per-person
driving distances through improved land-use and transportationTable 5

4.2. Aggregated results, sequestration, sensitivity analysis
The household carbon balance results from this study show that to
achieve carbon neutrality from a combination of lower emissions and
sequestration from trees, it is necessary to electrify both automobiles
and desalination and to supply all electricity demands with renewable
energy. Moreover, zero-carbon emissions would be achievable with no
changes to a household's consumption patterns (eg. driving distance per
year) or lifestyle other than possibly living in a smaller house, and/or
raising the thermostat set-point by two degrees. This is an important
finding given that a number of studies have shown long-lasting shifts in
human behavior can be difficult to achieve [108,116].
5. Discussion
5.1. Study limitations
While this study combines a range of parameters contributing to
household emissions, there are several limitations that should be con-
sidered.
1. The assumption that lithium-ion battery manufacturing can be fully
electrified is speculative. Currently, roughly 60% of cradle-to-gateenergy use is from electricity [97], mostly for cell manufacturing,
with total energy use ranging from 3.1 to 586 MJ/kWh [97,117].
The remaining energy is used for material production and requires
mostly fossil-fuels [118]. However, recent efforts to transition ma-
terial production processes to electric heat sources [119–121] makes
it reasonable to assume near-term battery manufacturing can be-
come fully electrified.
2. Embodied carbon (EC) from house construction [8,122–126],
transportation infrastructure construction [127–130], and both ga-
soline and electric car manufacturing [114,117,118,131] can con-
stitute a significant portion of total life-cycle emissions (LCE) [132].
Moreover, if sustainable energy and electrification transitions do not
occur as rapidly as we project are possible in housing construction
and manufacturing supply chains, EC will increase as a share of LCE,
potentially by a significant amount. The results of this paper should
be considered in light of this fact. However, this paper does not
factor in EC for a few reasons. First, a study of equal comprehen-
siveness to the OE study done here is outside the scope of a single
paper. Second, data and existing LCA studies in Abu Dhabi and the
GCC are currently limited for all sectors. Only one high-quality LCA
study for low-energy villa construction in the GCC region was found
[122]. More data is needed before a projective study of housing and
transportation EC in the GCC can be done. Third, within the broader
literature on EC for low-energy and Passive House construction,
there remains a large degree of uncertainty in findings. This problem
has been repeatedly noted in the literature [123,133,134]. Using
recent LCA studies for house construction (Appendix F), the authors
find that depending on the accounting method, geographic location,
house size per person, and construction type, EC could range from
35 to 23,300 kg CO
2/per/yr, and require from 5 to 4600% of a small
parcel's potential canopy area to offset (Fig. 4). Using two studies inthe GCC specifically we calculate a range of 113–311 kg CO
2/per/yr,
which could be captured by 30% or less of a small parcel's canopy asper this study. Lastly, because work is being done to enact similar
sustainable transitions along the entire supply-chain for housing
manufacturing, transportation infrastructure, and industry in gen-
eral [135–140], the authors assume future reductions in EC willroughly mirror the projected reductions in OC posed by this paper.
Therefore, the high-level conclusions from this study hold in the
long-run, though different transition rates for EC and OC should be
considered.
3. The conversion of expanses of desert landscape to low-density, ve-
getated neighborhoods is a key aspect of this study which does not
apply equally to all regions, especially those with constrained land-
supply or naturally forested landscapes. Additionally, consideration
for limits in raw material supplies (especially rare-earth metals)
required for road, car, housing, battery, and solar-PV production is
needed. Historically, lower density housing has required more ma-
terial per-person than higher density alternatives, though the impact
of this difference can be mitigated in the future through material
substitution and improved efficiencies arising from autonomous
vehicle adoption and smaller house design, among others.
4. This paper assumes that driving behavior will remain constant into
the future. However, the simultaneous adoption of both electric
vehicles (EV) and autonomous driving (AD) may increase the dis-
tance driven per family member or lower the average occupancy
rate. Both would increase per-person energy demands and emis-
sions, which accounts for 7–29% of total household emissions in this
study. Because there is not yet clear agreement on the projected
impacts of either EV or AD technologies on future driving behavior
[141–144], the authors held current driving behaviors constant for
all scenarios.
5. This paper uses averaged climatic data from the preceding decade to
run building energy results. A recent study by Radhi [145] con-
cludes that global warming in the region [146] could increase en-
ergy demands for cooling by 5–24%. If similar results applied to this
study, roof and ground areas required for solar-PV energy produc-
tion would increase, as would the number of trees required for se-
questration. These potential changes to land-use ratios and emis-
sions should be considered when considering the applicability ofthis paper's results.
6. The phasing of technology, tree planting, and house construction
with solar-PV deployment must be considered further before these
findings can be applied. For example, trees planted for sequestration
in Abu Dhabi, which require 20 years to reach maturity, would be
limited by the supply of recycled water until desalination plants
transition to solar-PV powered RO. Lowering the EC from house
construction supply chains (see above) is another factor that must be
considered when optimizing the net carbon of new neighborhood
construction in the near term (before supply chains have fully dec-
arbonized) to avoid the carbon spike resulting from new house
construction as much as possible [147]. Lastly, once desalination
has fully transitioned, laying out neighborhoods and planting trees
in advance of projected housing demand would allow trees to reach
maturity and full sequestration rates before houses began operating.
In desert regions trees could also be used for low-carbon construc-
tion materials.
5.2. Future studies
While this research outlines the potential impacts of various sectors
on efforts for reducing carbon emissions, several next steps can increasethe robustness and implementation potential of the findings. These
include:
•Further investigation of the negative environmental impacts of salt-
water desalination, especially its saline discharge on sensitive
coastal eco-systems.
•A study of cooling energy reduction through natural ventilationD. Birge, A.M. Berger Building and Environment 147 (2019) 77–96
85strategies, and microclimatic impacts, on humidity and temperature
due to dense tree vegetation.
•Detailed simulation of energy supply-demand balancing with load-shifting and curtailing using household and automobile battery
systems to test for off-grid operation [148].
•Planting and tree maintenance strategies and phasing plans (seeabove) to ensure maximum tree growth and carbon sequestration
while avoiding soil and ecosystem disruption, as well as roof-top
solar system energy losses from shading.
•Design and user-testing of smaller sized villas for Emirati familiesthat retain cultural and social appropriateness and acceptance.
•A context-specific cost benefit analysis of suburban trees to improveupon the results used from Western studies.
•A complete LCA study for housing, appliances, battery systems, andelectric cars under conditions of maximum electrification supplied
by solar-PV to allow sizing of sequestration for both operational and
embodied emissions (see 5.1 Points 1 and 2). The potential to shift
housing construction in the region to wood or other more sustain-
able materials should also be considered.
•Study to refine ranges of behavioral parameters for daily driving,
water use, lighting and equipment use, would further strengthen the
conclusions made through the sensitivity analysis (see 5.6).
5.3. Tree sequestration and future landscape design
As research has shown, there are benefits to localizing carbon se-
questration programs as opposed to global offset markets [149]. Animportant aspect of this study is the region-specific application of the
widely used tree carbon offset metric [150]. Such an approach allows
households, landscape architects, and government planning agencies a
nuanced and systematic understanding of the relationship betweencarbon emissions and sequestration potential resulting from tree
planting in low-density housing neighborhoods. It also provides a clear
understanding of the significant barrier to bringing the existing water-
energy nexus to carbon neutrality, as well as a prompt for rethinking
vegetation in Abu Dhabi if and when the water-energy nexus transitions
to solar-powered RO.
Due to the historically high carbon emissions resulting from desa-
lination, the role of vegetation in Abu Dhabi has been minimized to be
mostly ornamental with emphasis on selective shade trees in public
spaces [151]. If trees become carbon negative, it would allow for a
reversal in societal attitude and revision of landscape design principles
towards increased, even maximum tree planting. This change in atti-
tude would include consideration of other benefits that trees could
provide in the Emirati neighborhood context such as increased privacy,
increased walkability, noise reduction, improved air quality, microcli-
matic cooling, house cooling energy demand reduction from shading,
and increased property values from improved aesthetics, among others
[152–154]. Additionally, if outdoor spaces are cooler and more habi-
table throughout the year, families may prefer smaller houses for both
financial and sustainability reasons. Ultimately, single-family home
ownership and the resulting control of landscaping allows households
to calibrate the best combination of house size, solar-PV system, tree
planting, and technology driven efficiency for their specific budget and
lifestyle. The potential financial benefits of owning roof-top solar-plus-
battery systems, and the increased resilience to grid outages, is a final
advantage of single-family home ownership [155,156].
5.4. Technology costs and barriers to adoption
It is probable that no financial barriers will exist in the near-term
that would prevent transitioning to the technologies and house designs
required to achieve near-zero carbon operational emissions. While a
detailed cost analysis of the proposed transitions is outside the scope of
this study, recent studies project that electric cars [157], RO desalina-
tion [158], electricity from solar-PV plus storage [44,159], and the netcost of trees watered from RO water [160], will all have lower lifetimecosts than current baseline technologies (Appendix E). Additionally,
while building to Passive House standards carries higher up-front cost,
these can be recouped through lower operating costs or offset by
building a smaller house [161]. It is possible, therefore, that households
building new homes and buying new cars in the coming decades will
pay less than they would now, while simultaneously achieving near-
zero or even carbon neutrality for operational emissions.
5.5. Current Estidama regulations + future government focus
Results from this study show that Estidama's current regulations are
stringent enough to achieve net-carbon zero household operations
under a fully renewable energy regime (S3 …). Though these scenarios
require additional ground-mounted solar panels to cover all energy
needs, the resulting carbon emissions can be reasonably offset by trees
planted within parcel and neighborhood open spaces (Fig. 4).
7The key
missing parameter is SRO desalination. Without SRO powered by solar-PV (or similar renewable), a household's indoor potable water use alone
would results in yearly emissions of ∼8000 kg CO
2. SRO desalination is
a feasible option in the region assuming fouling issues and saline dis-charge impacts are adequately addressed. While raising Estidama's
minimum insulation and efficiency standards in the future would help
ensure a path to a low-carbon society, this study shows the more critical
effort is towards transitioning from MSF to SRO desalination. Without a
full transition, which is currently underway, Abu Dhabi will not be able
to achieve carbon neutrality without a significant, and likely very
costly, carbon sequestration program.
5.6. Sensitivity to uncertainty
Results from the sensitivity analysis for scenario S6 (Table 6) pro-
vides a more nuanced understanding of the likelihood of achieving near
zero-carbon OC and the relative importance of individual parameters.
Foremost is the need to fully transition to renewable (solar-PV) energy
sources and processes (gas to electric car, grid to solar-PV energy, MSF
to SRO desalination) (20-160 kg C0
2/%). Presently, besides desalina-
tion, households can directly control these energy and technologytransitions. If desalination plants transition slowly, households can look
to internal water treatment and recycling options [162,163]. Con-
sidering the outsized impact of energy source on final OC for S6, energy
efficiency measures are most critical for their ability to lower aggregate
energy demands below what can be provided for by roof-top solar-PV
and grid supplied renewable energy. Of the behavioral factors which
have a strong or moderate impact on OC (50-2 kg C0
2/%) most are
“lumpy”, long-term decisions which households need to make onlyevery few years or decades. This includes car type, house size, air-
conditioning system, and solar-panel type. On the other hand, many
day-to-day habits, which can be be harder to change, control less im-
portant parameters such as car use, indoor water use, window shading
(drawing blinds), and lighting and equipment use (1.5–0.1 kg C0
2/%).
Cooling set-point has the highest sensitivity of non-transitional tech-nologies and thus smart-thermostats which dynamically balance com-
fort and efficiency provide a low-cost way to lower OC. Insulation va-
lues and air-tightness have less sensitivity (0.3 kg CO
2/%) than might
be expected due to the dampening effect of the high COP air-condi-tioner in S6. This strengthens our argument that Passive House stan-
dards are not necessary to achieve near zero-carbon operation, and
explains why they may be counter-productive when considering full
life-cycle emissions (see 5.1 point 2). House design, as it relates to area
per person, remains a critical parameter in relative and absolute terms
7Of course additional solar could be supplied by utility scale installations,
but calculating the potential for household or neighborhood scale energy au-
tonomy has additional benefits beyond just carbon neutrality.D. Birge, A.M. Berger Building and Environment 147 (2019) 77–96
86due to its direct influence on per-person cooling energy requirements.
Lastly, consideration needs to be made for car occupancy rates (1.8 kg
C02/%) when and if households adopt autonomous mobility to ensure
that ‘empty miles’ and rebound effects are kept to a minimum [164].Overall, the sensitivity analysis suggests that the upfront selection of a
modestly sized, efficient home with a few key technology systems is far
more important than the family's behavior inside it. That said, cumu-
latively, behavioral parameters could drive OC beyond what could be
captured by on-site vegetation.
6. Conclusions
It has become a common narrative within the urban planning and
design disciplines that low-density, suburban development is less sus-
tainable than denser, urban configurations due to increased automobile
use and higher household energy consumption. Recent studies have
shown that this is not always the case [74,165,166]. Furthermore, the
results from this study show that future household emissions can be
lowered by a significant enough margin to be fully offset by trees
planted at the parcel or neighborhood scale. In the GCC region, and in
many other parts of the world, the preferred form of development has
been that of lower-density neighborhoods. This study assumes that the
strong cultural preference for the villa typology will continue in the
region. Based on this assumption, this study provides recommendations
that will, in the future, allow less-dense neighborhoods to lower per-
person net household operational emissions through technological
transitions, housing design improvements, and significant areas of tree
planting.
Looking towards such a future, this study shows a clear path to near-
zero and even net-carbon neutrality for future household energy use
(building energy, water desalination and heating, automobile use)
when the following conditions obtain:
•Electrification of desalination through replacement of existing MSFplants with RO desalination plants
•Electrification and increased efficiency of personal transportthrough replacement of gasoline powered cars with plug-in electric
vehicles
•Adoption of roof-top and utility scale solar-PV systems with enoughpower capacity to serve all direct and indirect operational energy
needs (building, desalination, driving)
Without these combined transitions it is not possible for efficiency
gains and behavioral changes alone to reduce carbon emissions enoughto be offset by household/neighborhood scale afforestation.
Nevertheless, these technological transitions are projected to happen
through natural replacement of older technologies in the coming dec-
ades due to their life-cycle cost benefits in many categories (see
Appendix E) [167,168].
Normally sized parcels in Emirati neighborhoods provide between
760 and 1800 m
2of open-space which could be used for tree planting.
Assuming the above-mentioned technological transitions, existingbuilding construction and appliance standards set by Estidama Pearl 1
regulations provides adequate energy and water efficiency to achieve
net-carbon zero operations with a required offset of roughly 30 trees or∼1200 m
2of tree canopy. Building to Passive House standards and
installing currently available best-in-class appliances further reduces
the number of trees required for carbon offsetting to 15 or ∼590 m2of
tree canopy. Future improvements to solar and desalination technolo-gies could allow all operational carbon emissions from the household to
be sequestered by 4–5 trees or ∼180 m
2of tree canopy.
In all technology scenarios, our model shows that improvements to
architectural and landscape design consistently reduce per-person
building energy use by 50–60%, which translates to a final per-person
carbon emissions reduction of 30–40%. This emphasizes the importance
of the allied design professions in fine-tuning the built and landscaped
environment to reduce carbon emissions and maximize carbon se-
questration. In the future, whether a household is carbon positive,
carbon neutral, or carbon negative for operational energy use may very
well depend on key design decisions made at the neighborhood, parcel,
and building design scales. It has long been argued that small, well-
shaded houses are more energy efficient and thus more sustainable. Our
research shows that these axioms will remain valid throughout the
transition to low-carbon futures [169,170]. Even in a world with zero-
carbon energy sources, reducing energy use through good design will
reduce the amount of materials required for solar, wind, and battery
storage. This is especially important for lower density housing which
can have higher per-person material needs than higher density housing.
The need to plan for the eventual performative coupling between the
built environment and technological systems discussed in this paper
puts an increased importance on phasing and land-use planning within
the urban design and planning professions. More broadly speaking, our
research shows the benefit of multi-scalar, multi-disciplinary projective
research and design which integrates approaches from the fields of
urban metabolism, urban design, landscape design, architecture and
engineering towards developing sustainable housing solutions.

Cost of Advanced Technologies Relative to Current Baseline Technologies.
Relative Costs to Current
TechnologiesComments
2018 2030–2040
System
Electric Car Even to Lower Much
LowerCurrent electric cars are cost competitive, if not already cheaper. Future electric cars predicted to be far cheaper to own and operate
[118,157,175].
Passive House
StandardsHigher Higher toEvenPassive House standards between 5 and 15% more expensive up front, with pay-back periods depending on energy costs. Smaller house designcan offset higher construction costs. Low-Energy construction standards, somewhere between Estidama and Passive House standards are likely
only 5% added costs [161,176–179].
RO Desalination Lower Much
LowerRO costs in Abu Dhabi are already significantly cheaper than thermal cogeneration, relative costs will only improve in future as RO becomescheaper and natural gas prices increase [109,158,180].
Solar
PV + BatteryEven to Lower Much
LowerUtility scale and estimated roof-top solar already cheaper than unsubsidized cogeneration (2.5, 7, and 9 cents respectively), offsetting batterycost*. Rapid battery and solar improvements should make systems much cheaper in the future [44,45,159].
Tree With RO
WateringEven to SlightlyHigherEven toLowerRO costs projected between $1.50 to $0.50 in the near future [a]. Average tree from Appendix B would cost between $19-$57 to water per
year. Net cost benefits of trees in United States context estimated at $55 - $107 for medium to large trees (in 2018 dollar). Additional watering
costs in Abu Dhabi likely produces break-even or slight cost benefit in near future [160,181–183].
* Assumes: 3 T Power Walls ($17,200), $0.07 roof-top solar cost, $0.09 grid cost (to government), 70,000 kWh/hh/year. Electricity savings = $1400/yr or $21,000 over 15 yr battery lifetime.
